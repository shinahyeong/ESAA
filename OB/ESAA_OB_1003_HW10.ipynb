smaller, with a very inconvenient bathroom layout, but at least it was quieter and we were able to sleep .\\n Large comfortable room, wonderful bathroom .\\n The rooms were nice, very comfy bed and very clean bathroom .\\n Bathroom was spacious too and very clean .\\n The bathroom only had a single sink, but it was very large .\\n The room was a standard but nice motel room like any other, bathroom seemed upgraded if I remember .\\nThe room was quite small but perfectly formed with a super bathroom .\\n You could eat off the bathroom floor it was so clean .\\n The bathroom door does the same thing, making the bathroom seem slightly larger .\\nbathroom spotless and nicely appointed .\\n The rooms are exceptionally clean and also the bathrooms .\\n The bathroom was clean and the bed was comfy .\\n They provide you with great aveda products in the bathroom .\\n Also, the bathroom was a bit dirty ,  brown water came out of the bath tub faucet initially and the sink wall by the toilet was dirty .\\n If your dog tends to be a little disruptive or on the noisy side, there is a bathroom fan that you can keep on to make noise .\\n The bathroom was big and clean as well .\\n Also, the bathrooms were quite well set up, with a seperate toilet shower to basin, so whilst one guest is showering another can use the basin .\\n The bathroom was marble and we had luxurious bathrobes and really, every detail attended to .\\n It was very clean, had a beautiful bathroom, and was comfortable .\\n The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was clean with a nice selection of toiletries .\\n The bathroom was an adequate size .\\nFirst, from day one our bathroom had a urine smell that never went away .\\n Otherwise the bathroom was decent enough ,  decent temperature and decent water pressure .\\n Bathroom shower curtain reeked of mildew enough to smell up the room .\\n The bed was comfortable and the rooms and bathrooms were kept clean and although the refrigerators are honour bars the hotel is happy for you to chill your own drinks in them .\\n The room was very nice, and had a nice bathroom .\\n The room was wonderful with great beds, a nice bathroom and we also had an excellent view of Coit Tower as well .\\n The room was small, with a king bed, and a truly claustrophobic bathroom .\\nAmenities ,  While this hotel isn't a luxury property, they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms, mini bar, room service and an evening wine reception every day   .\\n The bathroom was clean, well lit, and always well stocked with shampoo etc and towels .\\n The only odd thing was the bathroom door and room door opened outwards into the room and hallway respectively .\\n Room spacious 2 double beds gave us plenty of room, the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was a good size .\\n The bathroom was large and included a mounted makeup mirror .\\n The rooms are abit smallish  , but immaculately maintained, and tastefully decorated, with excellent bathroom facilities .\\n Shower bathroom was good with good shower and plenty of space .\\n Both the bedroom and bathroom had plenty of room .\\n large clean bathrooms fully stocked with everything needed .\\n However, when we arrived at our room there was a maintenance worker there measuring the bathroom counter, so maybe they're doing work in some units .\\n The room was large and very comfortable with a nice large bathroom .\\n There is a wall, mounted hair dryer in the bathroom .\\nThe thing that bothered me the most was the bathroom was very dated .\\n There is virtually no counterspace in the bathroom at all .\\n Upon our arrival, there was a SLIGHT odor in bathroom but nothing worth complaining about .\\n The bathroom was adequate with thick, fluffy towels .\\n The bathroom was large and private .\\n The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\nThe Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\nmy only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n The room was a good size but the bathroomm was very small .\\n Bathroom was adequate and clean and there was a hairdryer .\\n The wash basin was in the room without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath shower .\\n The bathroom had not been remodeled in alignment, but it was all very clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n The bathroom had several problems .\\n Bathrooms were also very nice .\\n The shower stall could have been bigger as the bathroom itself was pretty large .\\n Then they gave us a room which had a view of a wall, a tiny bathroom so small in fact that the sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n The room is not the most modern room but there was tons of space especially in the bathroom .\\n We may have had an ADA room because it was pretty big with large bathroom ,  it was room 459 ,  and the room had all the amenities we were looking for .\\nThe room   and bathroom were perfect in size,  just what is needed .\\n The only possible complaint was that the sink in the bathroom had a crack in it, but it did not bother me enough to ask for a different room .\\n Bathrooms, though, are plenty big .\\n Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly .\\n It represents value for money, the rooms and bathrooms were impeccably clean, fresh linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly .\\n There were plenty of thick towels in the bathroom, and all the usual toiletries, hair, dryer, etc .\\n I really didn't get a chance to experience the staff's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom .\\n The bathroom was also small  it was difficult to close the door once inside to avoid the door hitting you no joke !\\n Some rooms had the bathroom sink outside the bathroom, which we would have preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries   were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle .\\n The rooms were very nice, could of use just a little more shelf space by the bathroom sink .\\n The bathroom was clean but a little dated .\\n The only thing wrong with the room was the bathroom, it was not up to the standard of the rest of the decor but it was clean and large enough .\\n The bathroom was just okay, but for the price we survived .\\n Hair dryer in bathroom constantly fell in sink from it's holder when anyone used the door to our room .\\n The reasonable price of the hotel allowed us to book 2 rooms, thus giving the 4 of us a bit more space and 2 bathrooms   .\\n Plenty of room in the bathroom .\\n Nice clean rooms and a spaciousbathroom .\\n The only minor downside, as a few others have mentioned, is the bathroom sink lighting .\\n Did not like the bathroom light shining into bedroom   .\\n Only negative is the bathroom area is a little small .\\n Our suite we had was small there was pubic hair on the bathroom floor from  ?\\nbathroom a little on the older side .\\n The bathroom needed a face, lift also .\\n The bathrooms are quite small compared to other hotels but adequate .\\n The hotel was of a good standard, big clean rooms, decent bathroom and the free wine reception in the evening was an added bonus .\\n\",\n          \" It's quiet, get good gas mileage and looks clean inside and out .\\n The mileage is great, and I've had to get used to stopping less for gas .\\n Thought gas mileage would be better .\\nThere are trade offs that I have no problems with, my mileage after two tanks with mostly city driving is 21 but acceleration is very good, smooth,

smaller, with a very inconvenient bathroom layout, but at least it was quieter and we were able to sleep .\\n Large comfortable room, wonderful bathroom .\\n The rooms were nice, very comfy bed and very clean bathroom .\\n Bathroom was spacious too and very clean .\\n The bathroom only had a single sink, but it was very large .\\n The room was a standard but nice motel room like any other, bathroom seemed upgraded if I remember .\\nThe room was quite small but perfectly formed with a super bathroom .\\n You could eat off the bathroom floor it was so clean .\\n The bathroom door does the same thing, making the bathroom seem slightly larger .\\nbathroom spotless and nicely appointed .\\n The rooms are exceptionally clean and also the bathrooms .\\n The bathroom was clean and the bed was comfy .\\n They provide you with great aveda products in the bathroom .\\n Also, the bathroom was a bit dirty ,  brown water came out of the bath tub faucet initially and the sink wall by the toilet was dirty .\\n If your dog tends to be a little disruptive or on the noisy side, there is a bathroom fan that you can keep on to make noise .\\n The bathroom was big and clean as well .\\n Also, the bathrooms were quite well set up, with a seperate toilet shower to basin, so whilst one guest is showering another can use the basin .\\n The bathroom was marble and we had luxurious bathrobes and really, every detail attended to .\\n It was very clean, had a beautiful bathroom, and was comfortable .\\n The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was clean with a nice selection of toiletries .\\n The bathroom was an adequate size .\\nFirst, from day one our bathroom had a urine smell that never went away .\\n Otherwise the bathroom was decent enough ,  decent temperature and decent water pressure .\\n Bathroom shower curtain reeked of mildew enough to smell up the room .\\n The bed was comfortable and the rooms and bathrooms were kept clean and although the refrigerators are honour bars the hotel is happy for you to chill your own drinks in them .\\n The room was very nice, and had a nice bathroom .\\n The room was wonderful with great beds, a nice bathroom and we also had an excellent view of Coit Tower as well .\\n The room was small, with a king bed, and a truly claustrophobic bathroom .\\nAmenities ,  While this hotel isn't a luxury property, they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms, mini bar, room service and an evening wine reception every day   .\\n The bathroom was clean, well lit, and always well stocked with shampoo etc and towels .\\n The only odd thing was the bathroom door and room door opened outwards into the room and hallway respectively .\\n Room spacious 2 double beds gave us plenty of room, the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was a good size .\\n The bathroom was large and included a mounted makeup mirror .\\n The rooms are abit smallish  , but immaculately maintained, and tastefully decorated, with excellent bathroom facilities .\\n Shower bathroom was good with good shower and plenty of space .\\n Both the bedroom and bathroom had plenty of room .\\n large clean bathrooms fully stocked with everything needed .\\n However, when we arrived at our room there was a maintenance worker there measuring the bathroom counter, so maybe they're doing work in some units .\\n The room was large and very comfortable with a nice large bathroom .\\n There is a wall, mounted hair dryer in the bathroom .\\nThe thing that bothered me the most was the bathroom was very dated .\\n There is virtually no counterspace in the bathroom at all .\\n Upon our arrival, there was a SLIGHT odor in bathroom but nothing worth complaining about .\\n The bathroom was adequate with thick, fluffy towels .\\n The bathroom was large and private .\\n The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\nThe Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\nmy only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n The room was a good size but the bathroomm was very small .\\n Bathroom was adequate and clean and there was a hairdryer .\\n The wash basin was in the room without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath shower .\\n The bathroom had not been remodeled in alignment, but it was all very clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n The bathroom had several problems .\\n Bathrooms were also very nice .\\n The shower stall could have been bigger as the bathroom itself was pretty large .\\n Then they gave us a room which had a view of a wall, a tiny bathroom so small in fact that the sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n The room is not the most modern room but there was tons of space especially in the bathroom .\\n We may have had an ADA room because it was pretty big with large bathroom ,  it was room 459 ,  and the room had all the amenities we were looking for .\\nThe room   and bathroom were perfect in size,  just what is needed .\\n The only possible complaint was that the sink in the bathroom had a crack in it, but it did not bother me enough to ask for a different room .\\n Bathrooms, though, are plenty big .\\n Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly .\\n It represents value for money, the rooms and bathrooms were impeccably clean, fresh linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly .\\n There were plenty of thick towels in the bathroom, and all the usual toiletries, hair, dryer, etc .\\n I really didn't get a chance to experience the staff's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom .\\n The bathroom was also small  it was difficult to close the door once inside to avoid the door hitting you no joke !\\n Some rooms had the bathroom sink outside the bathroom, which we would have preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries   were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle .\\n The rooms were very nice, could of use just a little more shelf space by the bathroom sink .\\n The bathroom was clean but a little dated .\\n The only thing wrong with the room was the bathroom, it was not up to the standard of the rest of the decor but it was clean and large enough .\\n The bathroom was just okay, but for the price we survived .\\n Hair dryer in bathroom constantly fell in sink from it's holder when anyone used the door to our room .\\n The reasonable price of the hotel allowed us to book 2 rooms, thus giving the 4 of us a bit more space and 2 bathrooms   .\\n Plenty of room in the bathroom .\\n Nice clean rooms and a spaciousbathroom .\\n The only minor downside, as a few others have mentioned, is the bathroom sink lighting .\\n Did not like the bathroom light shining into bedroom   .\\n Only negative is the bathroom area is a little small .\\n Our suite we had was small there was pubic hair on the bathroom floor from  ?\\nbathroom a little on the older side .\\n The bathroom needed a face, lift also .\\n The bathrooms are quite small compared to other hotels but adequate .\\n The hotel was of a good standard, big clean rooms, decent bathroom and the free wine reception in the evening was an added bonus .\\n\",\n          \" It's quiet, get good gas mileage and looks clean inside and out .\\n The mileage is great, and I've had to get used to stopping less

touch and we enjoyed this very much .\\n Although we didn't use it, there was free Internet access in the room .\\nl also enjoyed the morning coffee in the lobby and the free wine .\\n The lobby area was really pleasant and the free wine   gets you talking to other guests .\\nThe free morning hot cocoa and coffee was nice before our daily excursions .\\n The afternoon wine and cheese was a nice bonus as was the free Internet .\\n We were surprised and delighted when, on arrival, we were given tokens for free continental breakasts .\\n The reception area is compact and during the free evening wine sampling gets quite busy .\\n The free morning coffee is also well appreciated and attended .\\n The free drinks are great if you and like the feeling of getting something for nothing .\\nThe free coffee and biscotti in the morning kept us going until breakfast .\\nEvening wine hour from 5, 6 was also good , free wine and nibbles and a chance to talk to other guests about places to visit , eat etc .\\n Very clean, get a glass of wine free between 5 6pm in the lobby .\\n Free high speed wireless Internet access, which in San Francisco most always has a charge .\\n With this hotel we received a free 1 hour tour cruise around Alcatraz and down to the Golden Gate Bridge .\\n You also get 2 free transportation passes each day of your stay that we used for the trolley systems .\\n And remember the MUNI passes were free !\\n The free drinks held every evening are welcoming after a long day out .\\n It was freezing cold in the room and I don't think it warmed up even with the heat on until the next day .\\n If you have any other questions please feel free to msg me and I will do my best to answer your questions .\\n The wine tasting in the afternoon made available from the manager

hotel lobby there is a free wine reception for an hour .\\n Nothing disappointed us about our stay and we didn\\u0092t even take advantage of the free wine tasting between 5, 6pm .\\n We did however make use of the free tea and coffee when we had an early start .\\n Earily evening free wine tasting   .\\n In the morning free great coffee and biscotti in the lobby,  with carry, out cups .\\n Another great thing about the hotel is that every day, they offer wine and beer from 5, 6pm for free for all hotel guests .\\n Then we picked up the free lobby coffee and the WSJ and the USA Today newspapers, thus having a cheap breakfast .\\n We particularly enjoyed the nightly 'manager's reception' when wine and nibbles are freely available !\\n The nightly free wine reception is a great way to meet people and find out what is worth seeing and what is not .\\nFree Wireless internet access .\\n Speaking of parking, you're going to have to pay and it's going to have to be valet service, as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .\\n The staff were friendly and the free coffee and biscoti each morning and wine at 6pm each evening were occassions when one could meet other guests .\\nThe hotel provides free hot drinks and biscotti in the mornings, which was good quality but why ?\\n Free wine and mingle from 5 to 6pm .\\n It really does save if you can get a deal with free parking, but the fee is not out of line .\\n There was a free wine tasting that the hotel put on that we were, unfortunately, too jet, lagged to participate in .\\n Every evening 5pm to 6pm, guests are invited to have free wine in the reception area and there is free coffee there every morning .\\n The hotel's evening wine hour and morning's biscotti hour also distinguish the property as

!\\n There's free coffee, teas at breakfast time with little biscotti and, best of all, from 5 til 6pm you get a free wine 'tasting' reception   which, as long as you don't take the p\\n No free internet here though .\\nbut it's great to get a couple of free drinks .\\n Excellent free wine reception in evening .\\n And free NEw York Times to go with it .\\n00 free wine and beer very popular and nice if you happen to catch it before you go out to dinner .\\nBeing the lushes that we are, my wife and I took full advantage of the free happy hour, arriving promptly at five, and not leaving until six .\\n Stayed for two nights and really enjoyed the free wine in the evenings and biscotti and coffee and or wide range of teas in the morning .\\n Refrigerator, minibar, free wifi, iron   board, hairdryer, down comforters   and pillow top beds .\\n The lobby   has a wine tasting for free between 5, 6pm each night and you meet dozens of really nice people from all over the world .\\n and the free coffee tea and beer wine daily was very nice and allowed for a cozy feeling among the quests .\\n The hotel offers free wifi   to all guests who have a laptop .\\n Free coffee in the morning, free beer and wine in the afternoon, what more could you ask for ?\\n Free coffee in the lobby in the mornings is nice .\\n The free wine in the lounge each evening was very nice, and given with good grace ,  even the fourth glass !\\n Coffee and hot chocolate were also available free from 6am each morning, although there was also a coffee maker in the room .\\n The only criticism I have is that there was no safe in the room, although safety deposit boxes were available free of charge in reception .\\n The rest of the immediate neighborhood seemed safe and nondescript, and largely free of the homeless and the street people that are in evidence elsewhere in this costly city .\\nA complete disappointment ,  from losing the reservation made through Best Western toll, free number   to charging our credit card for someone elses stay 3 WEEKS AFTER WE LEFT !\\n Dont let the &quot free&quot  wine and biscotti fool you .\\n The free beer, wine etc and snacks on an afternoon was a lovely touch and helped you swap tips and chat to other guests .\\n The coffee and biscotti offered in the morning is a good way to start the day, and the free wine hour from 5 to 6 is very pleasant, although we were so busy we only attended twice .\\n Great free &quot coffee and&quot  in the morning and a very pleasant afternoon complimentary wine .\\nI had read a prior review complaning about the fact the hotel had run out of the &quot free&quot  morning biscotti's as promised to quests .\\n We also always look for free wifi .\\n Internet access was not free .\\n Free wireless internet in the room ,  fantastic !\\n Best feature was the freebie drinks in reception from 5, 6pm .\\nFree internet use in the reception area was a great touch .\\n Guests actually talk to one another during morning coffee, and the free hour of wine at 5 pm .\\n In the lobby they have free coffee, tea and biscotti everyday and have wine and snacks from 5 p to 6 p daily .\\n The concierge even gave us a pair of City Passes someone had turned in with four more days still on them, so we rode everywhere for free .\\n The afternoon wine beer was a great idea, as was the free morning tea cofee .\\n The use of the foyer for free drinks between 5, 6pm was popular especially with fellow Brits !\\n Free coffee and biscotti in the morning is a nice touch but we never made it back in time for free beer and wine from 5, 6pm .\\n The free morning coffee and evening wine reception were both good opportunities to meet other guests .\\n Morning coffee and biscotti was a nice touch as well as the all you can drink free wine hour in the evening .\\n Parking was $26 day ,  free valet with on and off priv .\\n The hotel was of a good standard, big clean rooms, decent bathroom and the free wine reception in the evening was an added bonus .\\n The staff are friendly and there is one computer for internet access as well as free coffee and biscuits in the afternoon .\\n During that time there is a very nice and knowledgable gentlemen who offers free chair massages .\\n It's location is fantastic if you want to get to the Ballpark, to the cable car, on and off the freeway, to the wharf, etc .\\n\"\n

performance or provide better battery life depending on their immediate requirements .\\n In Super Performance mode CPU, Z shows the bus speed to increase up to 169 .\\nOne word of advice is to be really careful about which anti, malware software you install since it will degrade performance both on and off the internet on these netbooks .\\n Whatever you elect to install I would highly recommend you benchmark the performance both before and after .\\n I expect to get 6, 7 hours in high performance mode .\\n faster overall performance, and shorter charge life on the battery .\\n Asus' center of excellance is in very reliable, very stable, high performance circuitry, mainly motherboards .\\n I have the Super Hybrid Engine set to auto mode, which I'm guessing is less than High or Super Performance   .\\n Comes with unusually well, written documentation, though I'm still a little fuzzy on the different power, saving performance modes :\\n Overall though, I am happy with the performance .\\n4 PASS ,  Battery life is amazing, used the laptop in  Super Performance Mode  for over 6 hours of watching videos, checking email, connecting with USB Verizon broadband card, and still had battery life leftover .\\nAs for the performance of this little computer, I've gotta tell ya :\\n The performance is great for it's size ,  remember these are not designed to be speed demons but to be highly portable and cordless for extended periods of time .\\n Just some advice ,  use Eset's anti, virus and not Norton, McAfee, CA or the like ,  if not you will loose a lot in performance .\\n Upgrade to 2gb of memory, but did not seem to make much different in performance in either xp or windows 7 .\\n I find that the performance is great for my use on just 1GB that comes with it .\\n I keep a couple of apps running and its performance is great .\\nAmazon seems to be concerned that I am simply  experiencing performance or compatibility problems , , and that my computer thus does not qualify as  defective  by their criteria, , but I would contend that a new computer that cannot be supplied with electricity is a complete lemon .\\n The reviews on many of the higher resolutions netbooks also stated poor video and processing performance .\\n I haven't hit my swap yet in several weeks of heavy use, and performance has been more than satisfactory for what I do with it .\\n Replacing them isn't very hard given a screw and five minutes, and doing so noticeably ups the performance .\\n Otherwise its performance has been bug, free and met all expectations .\\n It enhances performance, but is not absolutely necessary because this unit is a full featured machine .\\nThe Wireless performance is great .\\n0 out of 5 stars Excellent balance of performance and value, October 23, 2009\\nI am very satisfied with the performance of the Atom processor .\\n This did not affect me much, I can write without problems full university texts, media files run without any problem   and the battery have been used for seven consecutive hours using the computer to the maximum in High Performance Mode without depleted .\\nThe small size makes it very easy to carry compared to a standard laptop, the long battery life is really great, and the speed and performance using various wi, fi connections was better than I expected it to be   .\\n The only area that I've seen, so far, where the performance is not adequate, is with some streaming videos, but that's not important to me .\\n0 out of 5 stars Excellant Portability and Performance, August 14, 2009\\nI'm actually downgrading in performance in getting this netbook but the performance lost is made up with the smaller form factor and greatly increased battery life .\\n I then loaded Windows 7 RC and the performance has been great .\\n After upgrading to 2Gb of memory   and deleting useless pre, installed software, performance has not been an issues .\\n I have the following software installed and they work great, modest but tolerable performance reduction :\\n No noticeable performance reduction\\n Performance reduction here is much less than superpi would suggest .\\nMy desktop is a very strong dual, core computer running windows 7 and I cant see a performance decrease doing everyday things on the netbook .\\n 1 light weight, 2 long battery life, and 3 reasonable performance .\\n Performance is good, screen very good, wireless very good, numerous USB ports, and keyboard layout is excellent .\\n Battery performance couldn't be more nice, as well as performance .\\nBeen very pleased with performance and battery life, however power supply went out after 60 days .\\nThe performance is fantastic ,  opening a browser, establishing wireless connection, opening PDF documents, opening powerpoint files and word documents is comparable to my newest desktop PC .\\n I had thought the RAM was too small for good performance but I was wrong .\\n I spent a bit of time researching the various netbooks currently available and thought that the 1005HA, P had a nice mix of style, battery life, ergonomics, and performance   .\\n The performance and speed of this laptop is amazing .\\nI was aprehensive about its capabilities while buying it but after using it for 15 odd days, i am very satisfied with its performance .\\n I use this setting but it shouldn't be used for movies as it inhibits performance during playback .\\n There's only 1 GB of RAM, and that's good enough for me since I'll only be running low, performance applications   .\\n It freaked me out since I wasn't running anything high performance .\\n0 out of 5 stars Good ergonomics, exceptional battery, performance meets expectations .\\n Very acceptable performance for what netbooks are designed to do

Font on the Home Screen   than on the K1 .\\n I found myself constantly changing the angle of the body, changing the font size up and down and the distance away from me .\\n I was an avid reader but increasing age has made printed books more of a challenge, but the Kindle with its varying font size and very light weight has made reading fun again .\\n What's more, it's easy to change font size .\\n The kindle does not recognize page numbers, since they would change radically when you change font size  so Amazon provides the notion of location which is display independent .\\n I just crank the font up a notch or two and leave the readers behind .\\n My eyesight is fine, but I can choose the font size that suits me best .\\n'Easy, on, the, eyes' reading with adjustable fonts and 16 shades of gray capability using digital ink :\\nMaximum font size is still not big enough for people with vision problems .\\n One or two larger font sizes would have benefited the visually impaired .\\n Downloading books is easy, the screen is NOT too dark, the font size is adjustable and the Kindle customer service support is terrific .\\nI know I need to go to the optometrist, but the Kindle will aide and abet me in avoiding that for a while , ,  the page is easy to read, the font size is easy to change, and my eyes sail across the words, my finger hits next page without me giving it thought .\\n The text appears slightly blurry and I have to increase the font size to read it comfortably .\\n And with the Kindle, I can adjust the font to any of six different sizes, which is of some importance to those with poor vision or tired eyes .\\n The font is clear and adjustable in size .\\n While they may not reproduce the look of a printed page, applications for these devices, such as ereader, do offer a variety of font types, background colors, and page turning mechanisms, the ability to read in either vertical or horizontal mode, and the ability to make the text scroll on the page, like a teleprompter, at a speed of your choosing .\\n The E, Ink screen is so much better than I thought and yes, I've read about the concerns people have raised about the Kindle screen and its fonts .\\n Sleek style, easy to hold, the white causes it to disappear as suggested in its description, highly transportable, well thought out button placement, easy to use, adjustable font, ease of downloading new books .\\n With good lighting   it is very readable and the adjustable font makes up for this shortcoming .\\nDictionary entries are now shown in your currently selected font size .\\n High, contrast e, ink, downloadable content, variable font size, integrated dictionary, integrated search .\\n With six font sizes, even the visually impaired could benefit from this feature .\\n Aa keys to quickly change font size, turning on off text to speech, Pause text to speech, change speech rate and speaking voice rather than using the menu .\\nThe font sizes are easy to switch between and very usable .\\n As advertised, it is very easy on the eyes, combined with font sizing and easy navigation this does what it was meant to do .\\n Very accessible and friendly for those with a visual impairment ,  all raised keys, font sizing, text to voice .\\nazw you can change the font size of the document without the  .\\nazw conversion the pdf will usually have teeny tiny unreadable font, this solves that, text to speech it, etc .\\n Due to being able to change the font it is also difficult to be able to read this for a class and reference page numbers from an actual book, but a search function that regular books , don't',  have more than makes up for this .\\n Being able to change your font size is really nice as well, but I keep mine at the lowest so I don't have to turn pages so often .\\nThe font size options include a slightly smaller font that before, , looks great .\\n I use the second smallest font 90% of the time and I do find I need a little extra light where I wouldn't have when reading a normal book .\\n I also really enjoy the ability to change font sizes, they are pretty close to large print books .\\n As I get sleepier, I like to enlarge the font, which is a nice feature .\\n Seemed like the perfect thing for an ex, avid reader, since you can change font size, have it read to you, download newspapers and magazines, and you don't have to drive to the book store or library !\\n The clarity of the screen makes even the smallest font readable .\\n Using the smaller font sizes causes eye strain except in daylight conditions with open windows .\\n The print appears faded especially with the smaller font sizes .\\n This allows only about 2 paragraphs of text to be visualised at a time at medium font size .\\n I have changed the font size so that it is so easy to see .\\n A couple of books I've purchased aren't great, fontwise .\\n Most books, however, are very easy to read, and the variable font size enables me to find the font size that works best for me .\\n While not as much text fits on a screen as on a mass, market paperback page using the font size I like, pushing the  next page  button has become second nature .\\n It's also easy to make the font larger whenever necessary, like when my eyes are tired .\\n1All the fonts look exactly the same, regardless of the book .\\n Easy on the eyes, font size can be changed and the book will even read to you if you want it too !\\n It's lightweight and allows changes in font size that enables ease of reading no matter how tired your eyes may get .\\n I also like that the amount of whitespace   as well as font size on, screen is configurable .\\n I can still make out words with the use of strong glasses and setting the font to the largest possible on the Kindle2 .\\n I like the small size, the grey colour background is relaxing, and its good to be able to change the size of the font .\\nI can make the font the perfect size for my eyes .\\n Although I'm turning pages quicker, my eyes are much less tired by using a bigger font .\\n It is quick and responsive and reading from the default font is easy .\\n Because of the ability to change the font size on the KINDLE she was able to once again start reading a book .\\n Everyone looking into the Kindle has probably heard about the font smoothing contrast issue which is exacerbated by the bright whiteness of the unit's housing .\\n However, just last night, I ran across a couple of user fixes for the font smoothing problem, and I've already put a  skin  on mine so that the contrast between the ePaper display's gray background and the  frame's  white is no longer an issue .\\n I have a bit of macular degeneration, and when reading the Kindle, for some reason, that little blurry spot does not show up, and this is at a small font .\\nThe Kindle 2 is lightweight, easy to hold, easy to read, and I love the fact that I can change the size of the font, depending on my situation .\\n I am in my 50's and the reading vision isn't great so changing the font is a blessing .\\n The interface is a bit like reading newsprint, though you can change the font size to 6 or 8 different settings .\\n It is so much easier to read than a paper page and you can adjust the font size as needed .\\nit's just like reading a paper book, but BETTER because you can increase the font size !\\nfont sizes and page orientation can be adapted to the reader's needs .\\n\",\n          \" After I plugged it in to my USB hub on my computer to charge the battery the charging cord design is very clever !\\n After you have paged tru a 500, page book one, page, at, a, time to get from Chapter 2 to Chapter 15, see how excited you are about a low battery and all the time it took to get there !\\n NO USER REPLACEABLE BATTERY, , Unless you buy the extended warranty for $65 .\\n After 1 year you pay $80 plus shipping to send the device to Amazon and have the Kindle REPLACED, not the battery changed out   .\\nThe fact that Kindle 2 has no SD card capability and the battery is not user, serviceable is not an issue with me .\\n Things like the buttons that made it easy to accidentally turn pages  the separate cursor on the side that could only select lines and was sometimes hard to see  the occasionally awkward menus  the case which practically forced you to remove it to use it and sometimes pulled the battery door off .\\n The issue with the battery door opening is thus solved, but Amazon went further, eliminating the door altogether and wrapping the back with sleek stainless steel .\\n Frankly, I never used either the card slot or changed the battery on my Kindle 1 but I liked that they were there and I miss them on the Kindle 2, even though, I have to admit, I don't actually need them .\\n It's also easy to charge the Kindle in the car if you have a battery charger with a USB port   .\\n You can't carry an extra battery ,  though with the extended battery life and extra charging options it's almost a non, issue ,  and you can't replace the battery because of the iPod, like fixed backing .\\n For one thing, there's no charge except battery power no pun intended !\\n Before purchasing, I was obsessed with the reviews and predictions I found online and reading about some of the critiques such as the thick border, the lack of touchscreen, lack of battery SD slot, lack of a back light, awkward difficult keyboard layout, minimally faster page flipping, and the super, high price .\\n As for the battery, Amazon's explanation was that it'd thicken the Kindle, so I'm fine with it b c the slenderness of the K2 is such a plus .\\nShort battery life ,  I charged this thing for a couple of hours, 24 hours ago ,  it's still running and just at 75% of full power .\\n I turned it on, noticed there was about a half a battery charge and proceeded to find my way around the thing .\\nFourth, your battery icon stinks .\\n It is so subtle that you can't tell how much battery life is left .\\nKindle is an  out of the box  reading, ready unit that immediately addressed me by my nickname, no log, in necessary, and could have begun downloading whatever I wanted over the 3G Whispernet within seconds as the battery was charging,\\nvery thin, light, weight, and attractive, looking with more data storage and faster battery charges with longer usage compared to Kindle 1,\\nWhat I'm ambivalent about ,  I don't find the battery life any better than the K1, I thought the K1 battery life was perfectly fine .\\n extended use of this feature will cut into battery life significantly, I've been getting 2 .\\nbecause the battery ran down .\\nA week ago, I ordered my Kindle 2 and when it was delivered, the battery was in critical stage and it would not power on .\\n When that came in, it was also in the critical battery stage and this time the charge light would not even come on upon charging .\\n Battery life is very good, even with the wireless on constantly .\\n K2 goes into sleep mode if you leave it be for a few minutes, but in this mode it still uses battery power if wireless is enabled .\\n Many have been critical of the non user replaceability of the battery .\\n I can do without the K2 several years from now for a week while the battery gets replaced .\\n More likely, by the time the battery no longer holds a charge, there will be a K7 with a color screen and 200 times the memory that I'll want to upgrade to !\\n,  Battery life is weeks at a time, even with constant use .\\n And the battery life has gotten a lot shorter too, again, after TONS of use .\\n which, I guess, is unavoidable with rechargable batteries, but I wish I could change the battery myself .\\n The battery was almost fully charged upon receipt so I turned it on and I was in business .\\n Good thing the nook boasts a removable back cover, because the store clerk had to take it off to remove the battery for a hard restart .\\nBattery life is pretty spot on .\\n The 2 days battery life was with the wireless turned ON which is wholly unneccesary in the normal operation of the device .\\nTurn wireless OFF ,  It saves your battery .\\n And I like the fact the wireless is a menu option, I just leave it on all the time anyways with little perceptible battery drain .\\n,  Battery life seems a bit longer but the K1 was good too .\\n The Sony takes 60 seconds   to go back to the main menu and used an incrediable amount of battery .\\nThe original Kindle had a removable battery and you could buy extra batteries in case you'd be away from a power source for an extended time .\\n The battery in the Kindle 2 is not removable by the owner .\\n The Sony is smaller and thinner and, I think, has longer battery life .\\n It's not clear how big an advantage it is to have the extra battery life, though, because both get you through a long day with power to spare .\\n the screen is small, and the battery doesn't last long enough to be used in the way I use books .\\n The battery charged quickly, in less than 2 hours .\\n If I didn't have a reading lamp handy, I find that the  Mighty Bright  clip on battery operated book light that amazon .\\nwould no doubt run down the Kindle 2's battery faster .\\nSo far, the battery charge seems to last quite a long time for reading .\\n I leave the wireless access feature turned off for longer battery life .\\n So far, it has taken anywhere from two to three hours to recharge the device, depending on how far down I've let the battery run .\\nI'm not pleased with the prospect of having to send the unit in to have the battery replaced when it finally fails and won't take or hold a charge .\\n Apparently the Kindle 1 had a battery the owner could replace quickly, the way a cell phone does .\\nSo I give the Kindle 2 an A, minus, the minus because the battery isn't replaceable by the end user .\\nSo my only real complaint right now is a battery the end, user can't replace .\\n And the lack of backlight saves on the battery .\\n I can leave it on sleep for days and hardly ever need to recharge the battery .\\n3The battery definitely does not last two weeks on mine .\\n With 2, 3 hours of reading per day, my Kindle battery has lasted me only 4 days .\\n No idea what battery life is like because I just gave it to her .\\n>> Better battery life, FAR better with wireless function on .\\n To me, this is more important than a user, replaceable battery .\\n>> It has a user, replaceable battery, though this is offset by improved life with the built, in Kindle 2 battery .\\n The battery life is disappointing ,  with the wireless on, it probably wouldn't last 20 hours of determined reading .\\n A single battery charge of my Kindle lasts almost two weeks compared to the 3, 4 hours on my iphone or the 5, 6 hours on my netbook .\\n Besides, I don't want to make the tradeoff of inferior battery life in order to power a device, native backlight .\\n Plus the touch screen consumes battery life .\\n4,  I like that you can change the battery in the Nook and you can add a memory card .\\n However I have IPods and I never use up all the memory or battery life .\\n Plus the Kindle 2's Battery life is 4 days longer per charge .\\nOh and one more thing ,  I've discovered that if you turn of  wifi    until you know you need to send or retrieve something, the battery lasts for many many more hours .\\n A clip, on light seems like a fine solution, plus it doesn't drain the battery .\\n,  The battery life seems fine to me .\\n I left wireless on for the first 3 days, and after reading through  Ur  and 25% of  DaVinci Code , plus lots of general playing around with the device and checking out features, I got the low, battery warning about 55 hours after intially charging it to full .\\n This feature uses a lot of battery and the battery lasts for maximum 2, 3 days but it is worth it .\\nI live in the UK, my Kindle arrived last Thursday and it was up and running in minutes as the battery had some charge when it arrived .\\nThe Kindle does not come with a UK power adaptor, so that has been an extra \\u00a312 expense, but I could charge the battery using the computer and USB cable .\\n The battery life is unbelievable too .\\n Also, I only carried my kindle on the plane to Japan, and I could read for over 15 hours and the battery wasn't even halfway over .\\n The books download quickly, the battery lasts a long time, it is simple to use, the bookmark feature is nice, and I love the cool pics on the screen when you turn the gadget off .\\n The battery life is great and I even like the screen savers .\\n I just found out how to save the battery and you can read for well over a week without a charge .\\n If the battery lasts a couple years, not being able to replace it myself will not be a factor either .\\n I've left the wireless on and really don't see tremendous battery usage yet .\\nAt first I thought,wait a minute,no memory chip,no exchangeable battery,a few other diff .\\nIt came with battery uncharged, but it charged up as advertised in less than 3 hours .\\n And the long battery life is amazing !\\n The battery life seems amazing .\\n While the Kindle 2 shows the title on the left as before and more readable, the battery life and network icons are in the place of the author's name .\\n By the way, Kindle battery lasts forever indeed !\\n\",\n          \" Keep in mind that once you get in a room full of light or step outdoors screen reflections could become annoying .\\n I've used mine outside on a sunny day, and the screen is still very much legible .\\n In fact it was much more detailed than the matte screen on my Dell D600 .\\n Some ppl may prefer a higher resolution screen but I don't think it's required .\\n I delayed ordering the computer because of the horror stories of bad batteries, faulty chargers and blue screen crashes .\\n1 inch screens, Windows XP operating systems, a plethora of USB ports, a card reader, WiFi and most have a few color choices .\\n1 inch screens are a bit cramped if several toolbars have been turned on .\\n Some of the Asus special on screen controls, update and expand features built into the machine have not been all that useful and some border on being advertisements for buying Asus stuff .\\n Two other things that make this a superior computer are battery life, and the LED backlighting for the screen .\\n The ways the screen opens   enables a smaller footprint when the case is closed, although it limits how far back the screen will tilt .\\n Surfing the net is a breeze, but I did have one  blue screen of death  when dealing with one demanding internet site .\\n The light weight, the battery life, the keyboard, the non, protruding removable battery, the bright screen, the track pad disable button and general ease of use makes it hard to beat .\\n I recommend minimizing the size of the scroll zones on the right and bottom, other wise you find the screen suddenly scrolling when you did not want it to do so .\\n zoom in or zoom out of a screen  , but on occasion it will zoom when you don't want or expect it to because of an inadvertent gesture or touch by a thumb, etc .\\n The occasional blue screen of death unfortunately has not gone away  Microsoft attributes it to an errant driver, but I have not been able to isolate what driver is the cause .\\nThe screen is not as bright as my Acer .\\n There are 2 bios updates and the latest is for a brighter screen setting .\\n This makes the screen much brighter and as with all new computers it seems there are always important updates .\\nAlso if you install Firefox web browser and push the f11 key the browser becomes full screen, helpful on a small screen .\\n I got used to the glossy screens a while ago  this one is remarkably bright and vivid .\\n Now I keep getting the  blue screen  serious errors .\\n wrote  it has crashed unexpectedly and displayed the blue screen of death numerous times .\\n Sometimes the blue screen of death appears for no discernible reason .\\nI began by considering netbooks with screens smaller than the now, standard 10 .\\n If money is your leading consideration, then one of these may be for you, but for just a bit more money you get a much better screen, better battery life, bigger drive, more upgradeable, etc .\\n But with screen brightness cranked up, bluetooth & wi, fi in constant use, some video playback  , and internet radio running, I'm getting a good 8\\n With wi, fi off & the screen dimmed, I don't think I'll have a problem getting the stated 10 .\\n The keyboard is not quite perfect, the screen doesn't tilt back as far as I'd like, slightly higher resolution in the screen would be nice a new model not yet available in the U .\\n has an 11  screen with the same or better battery life, .\\n It's small with a very clear screen .\\n I've had the 1005HA, PU1X for a week now ,  on and running applications continuously ,  without a single crash, blue screen, or hangup .\\n The touchpad feels great, the boot up was fast, keyboard feels comfortable, and the screen is good .\\n My only complaint with it is that the screen doesn't go back far enough .\\n The touchpad works well, the screen glossy, ness really doesn't bother me, and it's not too bad of a fingerprint magnet .\\n On full screen display is smooth and no issues .\\n Some iTunes content is a little laggy if it is maximized display, but not full screen for some reason, but switching to full screen display has taken care of that issue for me .\\n And with a two, fingered gesture on the scratchpad, you can enlarge or shrink the screen .\\n It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n On a full charge, with wireless on, screen brightness on medium, I get a reported 8 .\\n5 hours with no wireless, and screen brightness on minimum .\\n5 PASS ,  Screen is bright and large enough .\\n Once I configured Firefox to always run full screen mode  , surfing was no problem with plenty of screen real estate .\\n All features worked excellently for me so far especially appreciate the touchpad lock button  as well as the screen off function key .\\nheavy rearward weight bias so much that it wants to fall backwards  with the screen pushed back all the way\\n the screen is STUNNING, and if you've got a bright light shining down on it, you've got a choice :\\n you can either move the screen to eliminate the glare, or move the lamp .\\n I'd far rather have this beautifully crisp screen and make the occasional adjustment for glare, than deal with a matte screen 24 7 .\\nOne of the other complaints I'd come across is how for some, the screen doesn't tilt back far enough .\\nyeah, you'd probably want the screen to tilt far enough back to lay flat .\\n And if you can't wait to twist yourself into some contortion in bed where you need the screen to go back further than reasonable, you can always invest in one of those $20 lap desks ,  you know, the kind with the beanbag bottom, so that you can shift the desk into whatever ridiculous position will suit your fancy .\\nand I could have gotten a matte screen, but neither of those  features  impressed me .\\n Except for difficulties seeing the entire New York Times crossword puzzle all at once on the screen, the Asus satisfies my needs and seems about as fast as my 5, year, old IBM laptop .\\n I was also nervous about the fact that occasionally the image on the computer screen  shivered , although it normally recovered from that .\\n Also considered lower, end 14, 15  screens for use of the DVD .\\n I like the gloss screen fine .\\n The screen is too small for any meaningful work, but the apps DO work .\\n Again, the screen is too small for this to be anything more than just satisfying from a purchase standpoint .\\n like others have said, it is definitely a fingerprint magnet, and the glossy screen can be a bit of a problem in some lighting conditions .\\nI received my Asus 1005HA yesterday installed the two gb ram and tried to turn it on and the screen remained blank .\\nThe screen is small, only 1024 x 600 .\\nI can hear the windows but my screen is totally blank .\\n I can tell the backlight is on, but all I get is a black screen .\\n I don't even see the bios screen on startup .\\n The screen is sharp and bright .\\n The screen is clear and easily viewed in indoor environments .\\n With the view maximized, the screen is large enough to work on documents and read online research materials .\\n The fashionable glossiness of both body and screen acquires fingerprints and smears rapidly .\\n The shiny screen is reflective, which can be a problem if you have your back to a sunny window or work outdoors .\\n I keep the screen brightness set at about half and easily get more than eight hours with wi, fi on .\\n I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about as far as the screen brightness goes because my screen is far too bright at the higher end of the spectrum .\\n It is a fingerprint magnet, and because of the glossy screen, its very reflective of light .\\n,  don't know why they use the screen size most do ,  1024 x 600 seems cramped\\n Takes sometime to get use to the small screen .\\n yeah, the new LED screen technology is that good .\\nThe screen resolution isn't the highest you can get but I found that the higher resolution netbooks usually had older prcessors for some reason .\\n I'm happy with the screen and resolution choices available .\\n I usually run IE8 in full screen mode   with a 95% zoom setting and a 1024x600 resolution .\\nSurprisingly readable screen for the size .\\n 4 DO NOT GET WAX ON YOUR SCREEN .\\n Hit F11 and you have full screen browsing ,  just move the cursor to the top of the screen for the controls .\\nThe screen really is too small ,  1024x600 is barely livable .\\nWith the battery in the back the computer has most of its weight in the back so the computer easily tips back when the screen is opened all the way up .\\nScreen brightness is very satisfactory .\\n ASUS Docking is a program to have a quick menu on top of your screen to access all ASUS software .\\nThe screen is easy to read in outside lighting conditions .\\n My other HP laptop has a mat screen surface and is almost impossible to read outside .\\n Long battery life, sharp looking machine, fingerprint magnet,glossy screen=glare,ease of use and portability .\\n The most noticeable difference is the screen and keyboard functionality .\\n The cover and screen are glossy and it has a 92% keyboard which is plenty comfortable .\\n The battery life is excellent, with normal usage I can get about 7 hours easily, more if I turn off WIFI and turn down the screen brightness .\\nOne of the downside I have noticed is that the netbook is heavy near the hinge because that's where the battery is located and if you want to put it on your lap while sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .\\n Screen is nice, and adequately sized, , use fullscreen browsing .\\n I also needed Web connectivity for research, a screen with a low squint factor and a keyboard that wasn't too cramped .\\nThe screen size works just fine for me .\\n Having the touchpad feature of expanding zooming the presentation on the screen is a nice feature, but I have to admit having never needing to use it   .\\n And it goes in that bag wrapped in the white paper plastic bag it was originally boxed up in, with another piece of packing plastic between the keyboard and the screen .\\n, I'm still getting used to the small screen .\\nTiny screen compromises the experience of web surfing\\n I'll see the first black screen, it appears to be starting, and then stays with either a grey or black screen .\\n3 sometimes the screen will all of a sudden distort and I have to re, start to get it to work .\\n 1 keyboard still floats  2the screen goes to a solid blue screen either right after starting or after it sits a while .\\n Great battery life, decent sized screen, and the keyboard was large enough to be comfortable to type on .\\n Very nice, in fact, though I strongly dislike glossy screens ,  no matter, I knew it would have one when I ordered it .\\nThe battery life has been very good, especially if you follow the rule of turning off the wireless and bluetooth, and turning down the screen brightness .\\n9  screens, but felt that was too much of a sacrifice .\\n The screen is small but still large enough to read comfortably   .\\n0 out of 5 stars Bad LCD Screen, October 7, 2009\\n I fired it up and out of the box it has a vertical red line on the LCD screen .\\njust a big dark, screen paperweight .\\n The netbook is light and sturdy, and it the screen looks great .\\n only 10, inch screen, small keyboard and no CD, ROM .\\nMy advice is to visit a store to personally try the keyboard and screen size .\\n Decent speed processor, nice screen quality, great asus softwares  , and very long battery life .\\n pretty decent screen quality .\\n although the screen is relatively small to my eyes   it wasn't really hard to get used to the size and the screen is clear and bright, no prob reading articles and writing essays .\\nOne of the things that I found difficult to get used to is the size of the screen .\\n 10  can be enough for some, but it was kinda small for me, so the thing I did was try to max out the screens by removing unnecessary menus .\\nWhen using Internet explorer or Firefox, press F11 and the screen will enlarge, giving you some additional freedom and space .\\n GLOSSY SCREENS ARE THE STUPIDEST INVENTION OF THIS MILLENIUM .\\n Seeing reflections on the screen is just plain annoying .\\n As new netbooks come out, look for the ones with matt screen and see if it has a good feature set and price .\\n The screen is very sharp and readable even with the tiny text at this size .\\n With 1GB of RAM, it really isn't TOO bad to try to run Photoshop or something either  , but the screen would be too small for something like that anyhow .\\nThe battery life is unbelievable, even while using USB to transfer files, watching movies and surfing the internet with screen brightness all the way up .\\nFactory settings to preserve battery life have the screen luminescence set to 50% but can easily be adjusted to the necessary ambience illumination you may need .\\n The 1024x600 screen can be set, if you wish, so that it is a 1024x600 viewport to a larger 1024x768 desktop, reachable by moving the mouse to the screen edge .\\n This is useful if you have an application that demands a 1024x768 screen .\\n Screen appearance is enhanced by Asus software, and I do like the appearance and visibility in various lighting situations .\\n The 10 inch screen started getting to me on the Asus 1005 .\\nI love the capability of making the screen bigger or smaller with the mouse pad .\\n The mouse pad is very sensitive so I sometimes find myself on a different part of the screen if I accidentally touch something .\\n The screen is comfortable and sufficently bright for occassional use .\\n The screen is crisp and clear, and the unit runs great .\\n The greatest shortcoming is the small screen resolution .\\n Yes, screen is small, video card is weak, and keyboard is cramped, but this is the case for other netbooks at this price point .\\n I have not done an actual test of the full battery life but from what iv seen in general use it has around 9 hours while running wifi and other applications with around half screen brightness .\\n Streaming videos from Hulu and Netflix look incredible on this 10 inch screen .\\nThe only minor issue that I have with 1005HA is that it does not allow the screen to rotate further .\\n The screen rotation angle is good enough for putting the netbook on desktop .\\n Due to the size of netbooks and a wide screen format, the screen should have been designed to be able to rotate all the way back to inline with the keyboard .\\n The screen is very bright and sharp with a maximum resolution of 1024x600 .\\n The 10, inch screen is bright and has good color, and the keyboard is only slightly smaller than a regular one .\\n Performance is good, screen very good, wireless very good, numerous USB ports, and keyboard layout is excellent .\\n It boots up quickly, especially after getting rid of the extra asus software that auto, boots at startup, its battery life is phenomenal, the screen is clear and easy to read, the keyboard is comfortable to type on and feels natural .\\n But even with that, and the glossy screen, fingerprint magnet, limited screen tilt, tinny speakers, and intermittent odd glitches, I still think it's a great value and would buy it again today if I were on the market for a netbook .\\n Now the screen is cracked with big black blotches as well .\\nBlue screen crashed several times .\\nHard to see full web pages on small screen, resolution inadequate .\\n Instead I convert DVDs to DVIX AVI files using Fair Use Wizard and load them on to memory slot card and they play great, 700mb files look fine on this size of screen .\\n The screen resolution can be a little small at times, but that is a sacrifice I was willing to make .\\n Yes it does take some getting use to a smaller screen, the key board actually works better than my laptop though  .\\nI was worried the screen size would be too small and uncomfortable to read, but it has been great for everything I run :\\n Most of my professors teach from Power Points, and it makes my life so much simpler having the PPT on my screen that I can annotate while listening to the lecture .\\n I have not accidentally knocked it over, but I think it could easily be done  the screen is glossy   .\\n Purchased this machine to enjoy the convenience of Windows and the larger screen .\\n years old, so the screen size was also a concern, but it is adequate for the type of things I use it for .\\n As soon as you connect the VGA cable to an unknown projector and press the function key for projection, it automatically adjusts the size and resolution to fit the projector even if it cannot display properly on its own screen .\\n The keyboard is great and the screen looks good .\\n It's also a shame that this model comes with a glossy screen .\\n I personally haven't had a problem with the screen, but it would be fairly unusable outdoors in the sun .\\nFor this extra amount, I was looking for the larger screen, the longer battery life and the keyboard ergonomics .\\n I have more productivity  flow  on a conventional laptop with a full sized screen and keyboard .\\nThis machine is plenty fast, it's just that if I try to do work with it ,  my office's order entry system as displayed on the netbook screen must be scrolled up and down since it's a  chopped  1024 x 600 height screen, instead of the more usual 786 .\\nyou lose those 186 pixels and even one line of a large order maintenance screen can require you to have to break the flow of productivity to scroll .\\nThe small screen is probably the biggest drawback .\\n Could be better and don't use the highest resolution unless you want all of your stuff to have the wrong aspect ration on the screen It flattens it to make more visible .\\n Browsing is amazingly better by using full screen mode on browser with F11 .\\n That extra space the menu and address bar take up are sorely needed on this small screen .\\n In full screen browsing it is so much better that I would never go back .\\n Because the screen is so small in order to get the standard 1024x 768 display without having to scroll the normal screen the screen has to be  smashed  so the display is slightly altered .\\nOne hint ,  there's a setting that lets you  compress  the screen which makes everything smaller and allows you to fit more on the screen .\\n I mostly find that when I make typos, it's not because of the keyboard, it's because of the smallness of the screen, , I just can't see what I'm doing as well as a laptop .\\nAs others have noted, I wish the screen wasn't so reflective .\\n And maybe it's something I need to figure out how to fix, but I don't like the aspect ratio of the screen either .\\n Has all the features of my bigger laptop except a large screen .\\n1 inch screen is bigger than the 8 .\\n I want a netbook for portability, not screen real estate .\\n, I was willing to downsize my screen size in favor of portability and speed .\\n\"\n        ],\n

cable and a USB cord to connect it to your computer for updates and downloads .\\n update and reroute much _more_ quickly than my other GPS   .\\nUPDATE ON THIS ,  It finally turned out that to see the elevation contours at lower zoom levels   you have to reduce the amount of detail displayed .\\n it's a curiousity for most of us, traffic and content updates   .\\nThe text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n,  Speed of map updates is awesome .\\n I first bought it from another site that was cheaper by $25 and they told me that I needed to buy a memory card to download map updates .\\n Another big name site did the same thing and told me that I would have to pay Garmin to update to the latest maps .\\n The navigation display shows more information, such as next turn street and speed limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other models .\\nFinally, be carefull around Washington DC, because this unit has not updated the actual and latest detours arownd monuments and buildings, therefore taking you to dead ends .\\n This clearly shows how often the map updates even when sitting still .\\n Upon plugging my Nuvi 255w in the PC for the first time, it immediately informed me of both a software update and a map update .\\n The map update  are free for the first 60 days after registering .\\n The map update was about 2GB in size .\\n I have Comcast cable Internet and a quad, core PC with 4gb of ram and the map update took a little over an hour to download and install .\\n If you don't have a fast Internet connection the update will take some time .\\nI have held off from getting any GPS unit for a long time because I have a book of maps for the United States and I have always been able to update the travel  atlas  and supplement that with free maps from the internet via Google, Yahoo, etc .\\n_________________________ UPDATE__________________________\\n With the TomTom, if you update to the newest map firmware you get everything the Garmin 765 has minus the traffic .\\n And it is $79 a year to update the maps .\\n However, the points of interests are substandard, it would not pick up restuarants that we know have been there >3 yrs, and that was after we updated the maps, which was a 3 hr download .\\n> With your savings, you can buy Lifetime map updates from the Garmin web site for $119 !\\n> Links up flawlessly to my Mac using Garmin RoadTrip, WebUpdates, etc .\\n I ran the updater and there was an upgrade for the software and text for Jack TTS and Samantha TTS .\\n Today, I checked the Web updater again and their was a second update for Jack TTS and Samantha TTS .\\n Very disappointing that the product does not come with a standard power cable or even a USB cable ,  especially considering that is what you must have to use for software updates and product registration .\\n Then it said I needed to update some software I said OK .\\n5 It came with the latest maps  Garmin City Navigator NT North America 2009  and I didn't have to update it .\\nThe maps seem to be fairly updated .\\n I found too many users who said that the traffic update feature   is not all that dependable a feature .\\nI found the maps to be inaccurate at first, but after I updated them from Garmin's website everything is golden .\\n Otherwise you can't update the maps !\\n Also make sure you update the unit software from the Garmin website on a regular basis .\\n Use the  Webupdater  so that the unit is running at its peak .\\n I avoided the more complex ones as I had read that FM updates can confuse the device and changing directions after the obstruction has been cleared is not a good option .\\n It can be done by phone but if you do it that way you don't get the one free update on the maps .\\nI updated to the latest 2010 map soon after I received the unit, so the map is accurate to me .\\n I also like the way that it connects to the internet   to update all of its maps .\\n All I can really say about this, is update the Firm Ware straight out of the box, and when the GPS shows that it is acquiring signals   don't skip that .\\n I also like the fact that Garmin makes the most recent map updates available   rather than leave users hanging like some other GPS manufacturers .\\nOnce you have the unit, you'll want to update the maps .\\n Once receiving the unit, you get one map update download which must be used within 60 days .\\n One guy posted on the forum that he had an older device and paid to update to the 2009 map 12 hours before the 2010 map was posted .\\n Directions and maps are easy to use, and if you miss a turn, it updates your route in seconds .\\n I discovered that I need it while trying to register the device and or to get updated maps at the Garmin website .\\n More often than not, the estimated arrival time is updated 1, 2 minutes before the last expected arrival time .\\nMap update ,  when you register it on, line   you get an offer for one free map update .\\n I plan to wait almost the full 60 days to get the latest update, then probably never purchase an update .\\n By the time it needs a new update the unit will be obsolete .\\n MapSource also makes it easy to update your unit's map annually .\\n I have no need for the cell phone connection or traffic updates, just wanted a navigator to guide me from point A to point B as I get lost easily in my own town and to set up long trips .\\n The only nitpick disappointment was when I downloaded the free 2010 map update it dosn't show road extensions completed a few years ago .\\n Getting the prompted software update might have corrected that .\\n easy to connect to garmin to download your free updated map .\\n,  Also very quick and I mean quick reroute when you miss a turn plus smooth update position when moving, not choppy on the screen .\\n,  Updating the GPS took way to long and I have DSL ,  4 hours to download a 2GB map update and 3 hours to install the program to the GPS .\\n I read that some Mac user could not get it to update at all .\\n,  No traffic update but don't really need it\\n We started with a non, touch screen which was great, then we updated to the streetpilot C330 which was a dream .\\n The sound isn't that bad, Just make sure you get your free map update from the Garmin site within the 60 day time period .\\n Not so ,  tried the Garmin web site for an updated map and was told by Garmin that none was available .\\n Loading a map update is another experience I won't go into .\\n Haven't driven with it yet since the update but it seems crisp and with more detail .\\n Glad I updated the map and software .\\n Since the update , Drove it locally in San Diego and it worked fabulously .\\n in a  test  the day I received the unit, before map updates, I was directed to exit the freeway many miles before it made sense .\\n\",\n          \" You also get upscale features like spoken directions including street names and programmable POIs .\\n I used to hesitate to go out of my directions but not any more .\\n the directions didn't tell me anything I didn't already know after fiddling with it for 10 minutes .\\n It also does not offer an option to view the route as a series of turn by turn directions .\\n It gives your heading not in terms of degres but only in terms of one of eight directions   .\\nThe widescreen is a plus and I highly recommend it, even though it has the wide screen you can stick it in your back pocket which can be conveniently used for walking directions .\\nGarmin's nuvi 255W   is a handy little device that provides excellent value, but more importantly spot on directions .\\n While I recommend that you refrain from entering a directions request while driving your car, I note that some of the more impressive features of this GPS are literally one touch away, and so mounting the device close enough to you to activite a one touch feature would seem to be relatively important .\\n But leaving it on the seat next to you is likely to cause a few double takes because as comfortable as you think you're going to be just listening for directions, the fact remains that the graphics will attract your eyeballs like a moth to a flame .\\n I've found the directions in major metropolitan areas to be excellent .\\n but for the most part, we find that the Garmin software provides accurate directions, whereever we intend to go .\\nAnother screen at the touch of the button will show you the turn by turn directions coming up so that you can plan even better, especially in areas that you have just enough familiarity to be considered dangerous .\\nI like how the Garmin 255W doesn't make you type in complete directions when it isn't necessary .\\nThe only other annoyance of any time is that if you deviate from your route and don't indicate that you are detouring, you get to hear the Garmin repeatedly chastize you because it has to recalulate your directions .\\n No more firing up the computer, going to the site, printing the directions .\\n It speaks the directions so that you don't have to keep looking down at a piece of paper .\\n It allows for detours with directions on how to get back .\\n Saves mobile phone minutes, because you don't have to call and ask for directions .\\nTraffic directions are as good and detailed as can be, as you would expect from a Garmin, and less intrusive than on some other brands .\\nIn closing, this is a fantastic GPS with some very nice features and is very accurate in directions .\\n The sound is tolerable, but when you are hearing spoken directions a lot, it gets really annoying .\\n However, the TTS gave me few wrong directions during my trip to NY city .\\n0 out of 5 stars gives strange directions, July 6, 2009\\n The directions are highly accurate down to a  T  .\\n Depending on what you are using it for, it is a nice adjunct to a travel trip and the directions are accurate and usually the quickest, but not always .\\n I tend to be a technological idiot but I figure this out, right out of the box and I hadn't even read the directions yet, , this is major easy .\\n Gives you immediate directions to get to the location you chose to set up as your home location .\\n Allows you to type in two street names, and if they intersect, the GPS unit will give you directions to that intersection .\\n You can touch anywhere on the map and press GO for directions to that location .\\n Shows you your current latitude and longitude location, and allows you to enter new coordinates to set up so you can get directions to that location .\\n If you missed the spoken directions, you can look at the top of the screen for written directions .\\n However, I much prefer robotic voices to no spoken directions at all .\\nSome of the verbal directions :\\n It should tell me to take the Southwest Drive exit, or the Buffalo Gap Road exit, like the highway sign says, or like I would verbally tell someone to take if giving them directions .\\n So, although the Nuvi doesn't verbalize those directions, I can look at the screen to see the exit I need to take .\\nDirections seemed to focus on Interstate travel and I have not played with the device enough to know if it can be set to avoid Interstates .\\nIt lost satellite contact a couple of times on the trip   but apparently picked them up again because there were no skipped directions .\\nDirections were easy to see and understand .\\n The spoken directions are generally easy to understand .\\n Since the directions are also displayed on the screen, I find the occasional mispronunciation entertaining and not an issue .\\n It does know when you are not near a public road but it cannot give directions to the road .\\n The spoken turn, by, turn directions are clear and very timely .\\n My only real gripes on the software interface side would be its inability to show 1, way streets on your overhead map   and that this particular model does not support the Garmin routing feature that you can sync between your PC and their more expensive models to pick multiple waypoints instead of just a point 'A' to point 'B' directions system .\\n You can even get turn, by, turn directions from the program, and Google Maps has features that work with Garmin units .\\n Any time you're facing a closed roadway or are terribly stuck in highway traffic, you'll get a very slick change in directions to your destination given to you in literally less than 5 seconds than you ask for it .\\n button, and it gave us directions right to Carmel .\\n  The purpose of the GPS is to give me directions in unfamiliar locations .\\nThe voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .\\nIt takes a little while to get the satellites sometimes, but I just set it up as soon as I get in the car and by the time I'm out on the road and actually need directions it's up and going .\\n I had a great time torturing the poor thing and deliberately not following its directions while driving one day in downtown Sacramento .\\nAs with the 285WT, it gave me bad directions in one place in Sacramento .\\n I avoided the more complex ones as I had read that FM updates can confuse the device and changing directions after the obstruction has been cleared is not a good option .\\nI like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\n It loads quickly, have pretty accurate directions, and can recalculate quickly when I miss a turn .\\n Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n The directions were pretty right on, with a brief glitch with the distance it was calculating for some approaching streets .\\n I am sure I've not even touched upon the many features this GPS boasts, but for basic travel directions for the non, techie then this is a great product .\\n My daughter would then call my wife, asking her to plot a course using a mapping Web site and recite the directions .\\n Daughter Dearest now carries the Nuvi in the glove box of her car, pulling it out, plugging it in, and getting directions whenever she needs, in a manner that notably is much faster and clearer than reading a map or calling her mother .\\n When it comes to directions, I'm horrible .\\n There are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even Australian, American and British English .\\n I mainly bought the first one for my wife since she needs directions alot of the time .\\n It worked so well that people from the wedding were following me for directions .\\n In the week that I have had it, it's been spot on in providing directions and keeps up with the speed I am traveling .\\n The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n Amazon had the best price for this model which I chose for its ability to adjust the directions if you reroute, text to speech feature and 4 .\\nFor the first time in several years, my husband & I took a roadtrip with no  squabbling  about directions .\\n Directions and maps are easy to use, and if you miss a turn, it updates your route in seconds .\\n It has worked well for local driving giving accurate directions for roads and streets .\\n I was so tired of having to go to Mapquest and print out directions .\\n The voice directions give you fair warning when you are about to take a turn, which is really important .\\nWhat the 255w does best is find a street address, business, point of interest, hospital or airport and give you turn, by, turn directions with amazing accuracy .\\n I would have struggled to find with my usual combination of maps and Web, based directions .\\n The directions the GPS gave me were absolutely correct  , but the name of the highway was wrong .\\n Wish I had bought it about two years ago rather than spend a lot on maps and wasting time asking directions, especially in relatively remote areas of ME .\\n I spent 2 weeks driving around the Mid, West following Mapquest maps and directions .\\n I chose small towns as destinations and it always led me there without any problems, thus allowing me to enjoy the scenery of the fall foliage without worrying about using a map for directions or getting lost .\\n I use the map feature when I don't need directions which makes it easier to identify streets when street signs are obscured or missing  .\\nOn the negative side, the directions it gives to a given address are not always the best way to get there .\\n0 out of 5 stars MyOn, StarDirectionsReplacementUnit, October 15, 2009\\nMy new Garmin 255w had very Easy Set Up, Accurate Directions to locations, User Friendly Unit to anyone in my vehicle who tried it .\\n This unit has replaced my GM On, Star Directions unit in my vehicle .\\n directions routing are perfect .\\n spoken directions are crystal clear .\\n Practiced visiting places I already knew to see how accurate the directions and maps would be .\\n The directions provided have all been quite accurate thus far .\\n No more stopping at so and so gas stations for directions .\\n Map is bright and detailed, voice directions are clear and loud  .\\n It can be a little distracting the first few times you use it, but once you find the right mounting spot, it s like it's not there until you need it and then it's there waiting for you to with all the directions to get you to your destination .\\n I had no trouble with the volume level of the spoken directions either and found it to be an interesting and helpful tool .\\n Several voice options will announce both directions and street names, etc .\\nAfter a certain amount of frustration dealing with paper maps, missed exits and fumbling for directions in the dark ,  I decided it was time to get on the GPS car navigation wagon .\\n Also, there is there no asking for directions from passengers like spouses and children who have difficulty reading conventional paper maps .\\nOthers have said that the voice directions leave something to be desired in terms of volume and clarity .\\n It was accurate on determing original directions and recalculating when necessary .\\n But driving on the highway with music on and windows down, it will be hard to hear the directions using just 70% of volume .\\n I didnt know the address of the mueseum so I typed it into the unit and it found not only the meuseum, but the nearest garage, the places to eat, and directions were right ON .\\nThe display is very easy to read, and the directions were very good .\\n The model 255W that we received seemed to take longer to find a satelite, and the man's voice was very fast and not as clear, and at times seemed a bit confused in directions .\\n\",\n          \"Another feature on the 255w is a display of the posted speed limit on the road which you are currently on right above your current displayed speed .\\n I found myself not even looking at my car speedometer as I could easily see my current speed and the speed limit of my route at a glance .\\nMy final decision was to keep the 255w and return the 750 because I really liked the graphic turn indicator and the posted speed limit and current speed indicators .\\n It even tells you the speed limit on most roads .\\n The new display posts speed limit signs of major roads flush left on the screen, which is a new feature that is also really helpful, if you're driving in an unfamiliar area .\\n Display is excellent ,  the layout of information on the screen is very good showing upcoming turns at the top, your speed, the local speed limit and the estimated time of arrival at the bottom .\\n But the name of the game for thieves is speed .\\n With a reset button, you can track your max speed, moving time, stopped time, average speed total for the trip, average moving speed, etc .\\n It tells you on the main screen your estimated time of arrival which will change depending upon your stops and speed .\\n Well, you can one up him now by not only announcing the time, but the average speed as well, and you have documented proof of the reason you were delayed for precisely 7 .\\n,  Speed of map updates is awesome .\\n The navigation display shows more information, such as next turn street and speed limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other models .\\n TomTom seems to underestimate speed limits on community highways and gives sub, optimal routes .\\n For example, on the route from Rocky Mountain National park to Arches National Park Garmin's route is 40 mins shorter on a 7 hour drive because it chooses shorter route along minor highways instead of longer route along I, 70 with higher speed limit .\\n If you are driving in NYC or other major city, be prepared to add 1 minute for each red traffic light and beware that Garmin expects you to drive with a speed close to speed limit along NYC streets .\\n,  255w shows speed limit on most highways and some streets .\\n That newer interface, as another reviewer has mentioned, gives you speed limits on some major roads, shows you your current speed, puts the zoom buttons closer together, changes text size to give you road names, and shows you the direction of the next upcoming turn near the distance to the turn .\\n SPEED, , on most major highways, it tells what the speed limit is for that road   AND tells you what your speed is .\\nIndicates posted speed limits of the road you are on\\n On the lower left hand side, this unit shows the maximum speed limit for the road you are traveling .\\n This is very useful feature because many a times this will help to avoid the risk of getting a speeding ticket .\\n By the way, the bottom menu also shows your current driving speed .\\n That's what the car's speedometer is for .\\n And, it's nice that the Garmin tells you that, at your current speed, you'll reach your destination in 43 minutes .\\n When you are looking at the map, you are shown the speed limit for the road you are travelling on, and your actual speed .\\n I have noticed that when I see a speed limit sign on the road, indicating a change of speed limit for that road, the Nuvi is not far behind in changing the speed limit on the screen .\\n I can see that this could at some point become out of date if the governing authority changes the speed limit on a particular road, but it is a cool function nonetheless .\\n It was fun to know where you are and the speed that you are going and the time you will be there .\\n6 Love the speed limit and actual speed indicators .\\n I have observed several cases on an interstate where the 255W required driving well over the speed limit in order to achieve the initial arrival estimate .\\n The city routes were somewhat closer but they could not have actually been faster because of the numerous traffic lights and slower driving speed .\\nI really love the new interface, the turn signs at the corner, speed limit indicator and the fast satellite reception .\\n It has a lot of good features ,  including a speedometer, posted speed limits on major roads, and it notes your average and max speed on your current trip .\\n, alerting you that a rest stop is coming up in a mile, or speed alerts .\\n Lastly  , you can immediately see the speed limit for every road you are on .\\nThe local  speed limit  is shown on left side of the screen with current driving speed shown at the bottom of the screen .\\n I also enjoy the estimated time of arrival feature that recalibrates itself automatically based on your travel speed .\\n Having the speed limit show up on the screen was also great since I was in unfamiliar territory .\\n I watched the screen several times as I passed by a speed limit sign, and it would change almost immediately as I passed by !\\n I used it the day I bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .\\n The road I live off of, the speed limit is 45, the GPS says that the speed limit is 50 .\\n From what I have seen as far as the speed limit issue is that it is off only by 5mph, but dead on in other places .\\n,  The speed limit sign on the display is handy but in the first week of using the GPS I found it had the wrong speed limit a couple times .\\n The only glitch I have found so far is that the speed limits are not 100% accurate, although the GPS, amazingly, is able to very accurately tell you how fast your vehicle is moving .\\n I was a little disappointed in the inaccuracy of the posted speed limit, as I'm guilty of not paying close enough attention to those signs, especially w  interstate speed traps that are constantly changing up and down .\\n I also really like the way it shows my speed and the posted speed limit .\\n The posted speed limit on the screen is pretty cool too .\\n In the week that I have had it, it's been spot on in providing directions and keeps up with the speed I am traveling .\\nShows the speed limits on the major roads !\\nThe turn or exit instructions happen too close to the turns or exits when at highway speeds .\\n There should be some features built, in the device such as speed limit monitor .\\n This greatly helps the driver to keep his eye on the road instead of looking at the speedometer from time to time .\\n Some countries impose lower speed limit in residential areas .\\nOne unexpected feature is the speed limit and actual speed displayed on the map .\\n The speed limit is usually correct except on recently modified highways .\\n I often find myself wondering if the speed limit changed and I didn't see the sign, so for this one feature I leave the unit on even if it is not navigating to a set location .\\n If it helps me avoid one speeding ticket it will have paid for itself .\\n I liked the way it tells you the speed limit and how fast you are going .\\n It knows exactly what the speed limit is on all major routes .\\n It is cool to always know what the speed limit is and exactly how fast you are traveling   .\\n,  Tells you the streets speed limit\\n It is very easy to use, and when driving in the US  , it displays the speed limit and your speed, which is helpful when converting from Kms to Miles .\\nLOCAL SPEED LIMIT SOMETIMES WERE NOT CORRECT,THEN WE WOULD PASS A SPEED LIMIT SIGN & IT WOULD CORRECT ITSELF .\\nSHOWING ACTUAL SPEED IS NICE ,  ESPECIALLY FOR THE LITTLE WOMEN, AS SHE LOVES TO REMIND ME ALONG THE WAY .\\nPlus you can download speed cameras alerts at http :\\n I can't believe how accurate and detailed the information estimated time of arrival,speed limits along the way,and detailed map of my route, to name a few .\\n What I like most about the 255W is that it shows the road's speed limit right above your actual speed, which I find most helpful, since, again, I use it mostly in areas where I'm not familiar with the roads and local speed limits .\\n The new speed limit display on the 205 255 is quite helpful .\\n Speed of calculation, accuracy, and simplicity of operation are top notch .\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\":

windows open .\\n Another odd thing we noticed is a majority of the room doors opened OUT into the hallway, rather than into the rooms .\\n The rooms are on the small side but they're still big enough to be comfortable and are decorated very nicely .\\n The rooms were spacious and clean .\\n The rooms are clean and tidy .\\n The location was perfect for perusing the shops at Fishermans Wharf, we had dinner at Nicks's Lighthouse ,  the food was fine but the rest rooms were in a horrendous state, which completely put us off .\\n The rooms were nice, very comfy bed and very clean bathroom .\\n rooms somewhat small but clean and comfortable .\\n Although we arrived after 3pm, rooms were not ready and we were asked to wait .\\n We had 2 rooms, both were clean and ok, but strangely set up   and sparstly equiped not enough hangers, towels, etc .\\nWe stayed here for 2 nights, the rooms are lovely, very clean, modern, and comfy !\\n My room was supposedly upgraded to a larger room, but if this was the case I'd hate to see the smaller rooms .\\n If all the rooms are as small I would not want to stay for a long time .\\nGood Location Small Rooms Some charm\\n Free internet in the lobby but none of any sort in the rooms .\\n Rooms are quite small if you need two beds but prettily decorated and adequate .\\n The rooms were nice and the staff was very friendly .\\n Had read some reviews about small rooms ,  but what do you need the extra space for ?\\n The rooms are clean and reasonably sized .\\n Rooms are very comfortable and we were charged $15 for parking our motorcycle in the garage .\\n The rooms were clean and updated, the beds were comfortable, and the bellman service was fast and efficient .\\n Rooms were clean and had typical amenities .\\n The rooms were clean and well, cared for .\\n Although the rooms are small it was very clean .\\nWe arrive early and while they were not able to give us 2 rooms right away, they gave us one right away .\\n We'd seen some reviews saying the rooms that face the street are noisy, so by asking for a room off the street, we got a very quiet room .\\n The location is good and the rooms are very pretty and clean .\\n We were five people with two rooms .\\n We had street side rooms and all night long there were busses and loud noises so no one got good sleep .\\n Although the rooms are not huge, our room was still easily big enough for 2 adults and a child   .\\n The rooms were nice   clean .\\n The rooms are exceptionally clean and also the bathrooms .\\nI'm not sure why so many people say the rooms are small here, but our standard king size bed room was huge in my opinion .\\nThe rooms were smallish and could get a little damp if you didn't keep the air conditioning unit on, but the beds were comfortable, and the courtyard, view room we had was very quiet .\\n I agree with other travelers that the rooms are small, and the street noise is sometimes annoying .\\nThe rooms we had were a good size and clean .\\n I did have to search through the usual online websites to find the best deal for rooms, but if you take time to look, I think you will be happy with the rates you get .\\n The Hotel   rooms are very clean and great food at their resturant .\\npthe only negative thing's i will say is that the coffee maker in the room is a dreadfull waste of space and thee coffee pods and i stick of sugar and 2 pouches of milk a day is ridiculas there are no tea coffee making facilitys in the rooms to be honest as the coffee maker is just plain crazy .\\n The rooms are decorated well, not too flashy and yet still modern .\\n Yes, the rooms aren't that big, but after deciding that our main goal was to find a nice clean hotel close to Fisherman's wharf and near a lot of the public transportation, it was a perfect choice for us .\\nWe arrived from LA having paid the rooms in advance but were immediately hit by a $40 day surcharge to park our car .\\nThe rooms were a decent size for a city hotel and were very clean and well serviced .\\nParking is expensive, Rooms are on the small side .\\n The rooms are probably smaller than at a major chain, but you're not here to sit in your room .\\n The rooms are done in an Italian hue, and recently new carpet through out the entire hotel and our floor .\\n The rooms were large and comfortable and the location was fine if you don't mind a little walking to the Wharf and other attractions .\\nI don't know about the street view rooms but we had no problems with noise whatsoever .\\nThe rooms were pleasant, clean and did not disappoint .\\n Perhaps they like to let out all the 'close to lift ' rooms to be kind to housekeeping ?\\nBooked two rooms on Priceline for $139 each, just an overnight stay while flying home the next morning .\\n Check in was good, rooms both ready, and we upgraded with no problems .\\n older hotel with smaller rooms but updated nicely .\\n It was pretty small, so I'm sure the standard rooms are even smaller !\\n The rooms are very nice and seem recently upgraded .\\n We have stayed at this hotel once before, a few years ago, so knew that the rooms were not particularly large .\\n Some say the rooms are small, but ours wasn't that tiny .\\n A normal size hotel room compared to other hotel rooms we have stayed in, besides we didn't spend much time in the room when there is so much to do around San Francisco .\\n The rooms were small, very small .\\n The staff at the hotel more than made up for the tiny rooms .\\nThe only other negative and its a small one, was the size of the rooms,they are tiny but were cleaned well and were ready when we returned every day .\\n The rooms were very nice, clean and comfortable .\\n They said they noticed we had three people so had automatically provided a cot to our room, I was told they were full and there were no other rooms available .\\n The rooms were a little bit tired and with the simple expedient of renewing the wallcovering would show a great improvement .\\n The bed was comfortable and the rooms and bathrooms were kept clean and although the refrigerators are honour bars the hotel is happy for you to chill your own drinks in them .\\nThe rooms were nice, comfortable, and clean .\\n Our rooms faced the street rather than the courtyard and the traffic ,  especially the motorcycles ,  were loud all night long .\\n I suggest you request a room facing the courtyard even numbered rooms, I think ?\\nVery comfortable beds and rooms ,  nice decor !\\n rooms are clean,new, quiet, and relaxing .\\n Be sure to ask not to be put in the rooms right above the driveway entry .\\n Rooms are small, but they have everything you need .\\n The rooms are abit smallish  , but immaculately maintained, and tastefully decorated, with excellent bathroom facilities .\\nReally enjoyed the friendliness of the staff and the big rooms .\\nGreat rooms  great staff  great hotel\\n The hotel had nIce, well, decorated, fairly, modern rooms .\\nExcellent location friendly staff clean and pleasant rooms\\nI was forwarned to expect small rooms, but I thought the Tuscan Inn had rooms typical or even generous for an urban hotel , exceeded my expectations .\\n Rooms nice, beds very comfortable !\\nwe found a friendly staff through out the hotel great location,rooms were small but as pointed out to me all land is prime in the area and all places have small rooms .\\n00am because our ventilation started clicking non, stop, , repair person came, suggested we just move rooms .\\n But, we couldn't move again because there were no other rooms available with king .\\n The beds very comfortable, rooms tastefully decorated and were very clean and comfortable .\\n The rooms were nice but not spectaular .\\nThe location  the rooms  the staff  the concierge  the Managers nightly wine reception    everything about this hotel made our holiday MAGIC .\\n Currently   they are remodeling some rooms on the upper floors, and there is considerable construction noise in some areas that started after 9 :\\n I am so dispapointed that I can't remember what room # it was becasue apparantly after reading other reviews, there are some newer and nicer rooms .\\n The rooms are large comfortable and well furnished, suitable for business travelers or tourists .\\nThe pics of the rooms are the same as they present them online .\\n I thought the rooms were good .\\n different rates for their rooms .\\n The hotel was clean, quiet, large rooms and very close to the Wharf and local restaurants .\\n Rooms were a bit small and appear to be older construction, rooms facing the road are a bit noisey at AM rush hour so we requested to be moved to the courtyard side which was a good move .\\n The rooms were decent size, clean and had all of the basic amenities .\\n I was surprised by the size of it, because we've stayed in other hotel rooms in large cities and the rooms were always tiny .\\nThe travel agent booked this hotel and this was the only hotel out of 10 that I did not book myself although hotel sounded ok This was part of the deal for the airfares  Location is excellent , Rooms Ok Staff variable some very helpful others not so  .\\n The rooms   that number 401, 402, 403, 405, 406, 408, 409, 412, 414, and 415 face out to the main street .\\nStayed for two nights, there were six of us in three rooms .\\nVery cleanSmall rooms, but have a couch, chair, desk, etc .\\n, Get in inside room facing courtyard if you are light sleeper as outside rooms face the streets .\\n The rooms seemed to have been recently renovated with updated decor .\\nThe hotel is newly decorated and rooms are a nice size, extremely new and clean .\\n The rooms and the double beds were very small, both quite a bit smaller than the Tenaya .\\nWe had booked two connecting rooms since we were travelling with our boys, ages 11   15, and I called several days prior to arriving to remind them of our request .\\n We took just one room for that night and they moved us to adjacent, though not connecting, rooms the next two nights .\\n Beware, if you request adjoining rooms, they are not guaranteed and really not even planned .\\n They told me they don't assign rooms until the day of check, in, and they were also overbooked .\\nGreat location clean rooms we enjoyed our visit .\\n The rooms are a bit small, but not uncomfortably so .\\nThis hotel offers clean, well, kept rooms which are good value for money .\\n The staff was very helpful and the rooms were well apportioned .\\n The rooms are a bit small for more than three adults .\\n Apparently the inner rooms have the wall units .\\n The rooms were clean, nicely decorated, and comfortable .\\n We made our reservations several months ahead of time and requested two adjacent double rooms as my husband and I were travelling with our two teenage daughters .\\n They gave us two rooms on the same floor but on opposite sides of the hotel .\\n We've gone many places and made this request and this hotel is the first one that did not put us within a couple rooms of each other .\\n Nevertheless, I did like this hotel,  the rooms, location, and most of the service and I would stay here again .\\nGreat place to stay ,  very clean and confortable rooms and helpful staff .\\n I would recommend this hotel as a good base for a short break to San Fran ,  the hotel rooms weren't the biggest so a longer stay might not be as enjoyable\\n I asked the desk clerk when we checked in if the rooms were as small as they said they were in the reviews .\\n The hotel is pretty much as you'd expect from the chain , nice clean rooms well serviced, and the staff were extremely helpful,  very pleasant to deal with .\\n In our opinion, a bit of faux Italian d\\u00e9cor, some nice throw pillows on the bed and smaller than average rooms doesn\\u0092t really stretch to \\u0093European, style Boutique Hotel\\u0094 .\\n I asked the front desk whether we could move rooms .\\n The woman was very helpful and said that as they had declared a number of rooms non, smoking she could offer me a room on the 2nd floor which would be much quieter as it faced a wall .\\n Alarm bells rang in my head when she said they had made rooms non, smoking but I agreed to go and look .\\n She told me that due to the high number of non, smoking rooms requested they had to make more rooms available .\\n Also, avoid rooms on the ground floor facing Mason Street \\u0096 not only will the street noise be terrible but there is a permanent smell of stale urine along that sidewalk .\\n Boudin Bakery an excellent nearby option for breakfast lunch and with Trader Joes right next door you should not need to avail yourself of the very expensive mini bar in the rooms .\\n The rooms were cozy, very tastefully done and included a fantastic bed .\\nThe hotel was nicely decorated and so too were the rooms .\\n Rooms are small but very quaint .\\nUpon arriving late through no fault of our own and finding our room double booked we were put up in a nearby sister hotel   until our room was ready the next day and they give us a complimentary bottle of champagne ,  after this though there were no more snags and everything went great ,  hotel staff friendly and helpful ,  rooms were quiet, clean and comfortable ,  food in the restaurant fabulous ,  the situation of the hotel was very convenient ,  just a few mins walk from fishermans wharf with a public transport stop, supermarket, small shops, bars and cafes also really close at hand ,  approx 10 mins walking distance for ferries to alcatraz and bay cruise, etc ,  would definitely stop here again\\n Rooms good, decor very well done in Italian style Tuscan !\\n Rooms very impressively decorated and clean .\\nthe beds are great, several good pillows and the rooms are super .\\n The furnishings are superb, rooms comfortable, and the icing on the cake was that every evening between 5 and 6pm they put on wine and beer tasting

in the other with a connecting door .\\nDownsides are disinterested staff, bordering on rude and quite small rooms .\\n The rooms were gorgeous, decorated in black, white, red and some green here and there .\\n I'm a travel agent so I'm pretty picky about my hotel rooms but I have to say I will be suggesting this hotel to my clients .\\n The rooms are on the small side but if your not traveling with a big family or a lot of luggage, these rooms are just fine .\\n Our rooms were of adequate size, very clean and as requested overlooking the courtyard area, which was very pretty .\\n The rooms are spotless and the employees are as nice as you could ever want .\\n Ask to see a few rooms before you check in, because the room size and location can vary between floors and sides .\\nBUT ,  the external facing rooms can be noisy from traffic, so make sure you request an internal room, facing the courtyard .\\n The hotel has 4 levels with a variety of King, Double, King Suite and Double Suite rooms available .\\n This was not what we wanted but there were no rooms with 2 regular beds and it was late at night .\\n Great clean rooms with a fantastic shower !\\n Rooms are a bit tight especially if you get the two doubles .\\n Also, we got connecting rooms, but check first because there are only so many available .\\nThe rooms are pretty standard size, were nice and clean, and comfortable .\\nOur family of five stayed in two rooms at the Tuscan Inn for two nights during the first week in January .\\n It seems to be an older hotel, with the resulting small rooms, but is very attractive .\\n Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly .\\n The rooms are a bit small, but not unusual for San Francisco .\\n It has everthing you need to have a great time in a great city,  location, good service, great food  , comfortable rooms

Express ,  rooms of equivalent price and size but no mini, bar and, though air, conditioned, no persistent drone when in the &quot off&quot  position ,  though request a room at the front ,  a streetcar line runs at the back and those drivers love to ring the bell !\\n We joked about the rooms being sound proof since we never heard other guests and we slept great .\\n Apparently, all the rooms are similarly afflicted .\\n Streets in the neighborhood carry a lot of traffic, and rooms on the streetside might be too noisy for your tastes .\\n The rooms are small but very clean, charmingly decorated with a view of the little flowered courtyard, comfy beds, plenty of pillows   towels and smiling service .\\n I really didn't get a chance to experience the staff's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom .\\n We stayed there with another couple in 2 rooms .\\n I was totally amazed that the other guests didn't budge out of the way so we could get to our rooms .\\n Our rooms were very small but beautifully decorated .\\n Some rooms had the bathroom sink outside the bathroom, which we would have preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n While the rooms were lovely for that price they were extremely small, but the location was just perfect .\\n The rooms were very nice, could of use just a little more shelf space by the bathroom sink

The rooms were also quiet and we felt safe .\\n The rooms were celan and well kept .\\nArrived before check in and was told that two courtyard rooms were reserved for my party and available at 3 :\\n40 and my rooms were not even ready .\\n Upon entering our rooms, we see that our view was not of the courtyard, but of a brick wall .\\n Their response was that there were no courtyard rooms available .\\n Why they promise two rooms with a courtyard view, when they don't even have one to offer is beyond me .\\nI feared the room size because of the other reviews, but I think we got lucky and received one of their larger rooms .\\nThe rooms were freshly and creatively decorated, and meticulously clean .\\nA wonderful stay, staff especially friendly, complimentary wine tasting a definite plus, rooms well appointed and well kept .\\n Extremely comfortable rooms, with minibar, TV, alarm clock, ironing board and iron, moring newspaper .\\n Our rooms were so much nicer then we

clean and have windows that actually open to the outside .\\n We never heard a sound from other rooms besides the door next to ours opening and closing .\\n One of the smallest rooms in any Best Western I have stayed in .\\n We asked at front desk and then said they would send someone up in 10 minutes, over 1 hour later no sign so we asked to move rooms .\\nGot to hotel, disappointed in the incredibly small rooms, but location is great .\\n Website also said rooms had been recently redecorated ,  guess they forgot our 2 rooms ,  kind of shabby .\\n Asked next morning ,  still told we couldn't empty them ,  offered to pull up website on our laptop which still showed that fridges came with rooms but they didn't want to see it ,  they just wanted to say that there rooms never had fridges and didn't know why BW advertised that they did .\\n It was actually two rooms, with a sofa bed, desk, coffee table, and television in the first room, and a bed, dresser, and television in a seperate room .\\n They did switch rooms eventually and even the bellhop thought it smelled horrid in the room .\\nSmall rooms, we could barely fit two adults and two children in the room .\\n It is in a great location, the rooms are clean and comfortable and the managers wine hour is a welcome bonus .\\n While this was an older hotel, it has been kept up well and the rooms were satisfactory .\\n The rooms were great and the Service wonderful .\\nThe rooms and building are quite nice ,  location is excellent .\\nThe rooms were clean and well appointed ,  the maid staff were excellent .\\nMy

Nice clean rooms and a spaciousbathroom .\\ngreat rooms fantastic location and great service !\\nMy husband and i stayed here for 2 nights in march, I was concermed by the number of comments regarding the size of the rooms ,  yes they are a little on the small size but as there was only 2 of us plus my toddler daughter we found them to be more than adequate and very family friendly particularly liked the lock on the mini bar fridge door which housed a seemlessly endless supply of candy !\\n A warm welcome on arrival and a nice suite although the rooms were quite compact, however I understand this is common in Fishermans Wharf  .\\nApart from that, the staff were very friendly and helpful, the rooms were nicely decorated, and the beds were very comfortable .\\n the rooms are very clean and are charmingly appointed  the staff could not be friendlier, and they knock themselves out to make guests feel welcome .\\n The hotel is an Italian mediterrean theme everywhere, entrance, lobby, garden courtyard, restaurant, and rooms .\\n The staff were helpful and attentive, the rooms were quite spacious and the whole place looked as if it was cared for .\\n We had rooms that opened onto the garden and they were quiet .\\n the rooms are small but very nice .\\n Not the best place to be with kids, , smallish rooms, overpriced restaurant   and no pool, but I would stay there again if it were only the 2 of us .\\n Rooms were a bit small but very clean and nicely maintained .\\n Took the advice of other past guests and asked for 4th floor rooms which were very quiet .\\n The room was clean, warm and comfortable but don't expect a great view from any of the rooms .\\n Rooms   were cosy but had everything you wanted inc .\\n the wooden blinds don't keep the rooms dark enough once the sun rises, street noise was a bit loud I bought a set of ear plugs .\\n The rooms on the outer perimeter do get some street noise, but that didn't keep us from sleeping well .\\n The price prohibited booking 2 rooms, which we had done in Vegas and Anaheim .\\n We glimpsed rooms containing 2 Queen beds and they seemed to have more space .\\nThe rooms were tiny and still decorated in the 70s style .\\n We have 4 children and we booked two adjoining rooms .\\n I agree with other reviews that the rooms were on the smaller side, but we thought the hotel was great overall .\\n Yes, the

although mine   could have been bigger .\\n The rooms were a little smaller than what I was use to but I believe that is common in San Francisco .\\n And value is key for the rooms and the service !\\n The rooms are sometimes small, but when you're in San Francisco, you don't spend much time in it .\\n The service is always great and the rooms very clean .\\n Am sorry for those few noisey rooms that some folks got saddled with .\\n The rooms are very clean and very well appointed .\\n\",\n          \" Both of us having worked in tourism for over 14 years were very disappointed at the level of service provided by this gentleman .\\n The service was good, very friendly staff and we loved the free wine reception each night .\\n Also, thanks to Ken the concierge for recommending Grand Limo service .\\n The restaurant is not cheap but is very well patronised and the service is very good as is the food .\\n Service was spotty  Front desk was marginally helpful .\\n This tuscan, themed hotel was charming, clean   comfortable and the complimentary concierge service was so helpful .\\nPhenominal Service, great room, great location ,  couldn't have asked for more .\\n It has some charms in decor, and all staff gave very good service to us .\\n The rooms were clean and updated, the beds were comfortable, and the bellman service was fast and efficient .\\n A highlight of our

value !\\nSo to sum up if your looking for somewhere to lay your head after a long day then this is the place for you if your looking for something a bit special with good customer service avoid this place like the plague\\nI did not take advantage of the concierge service, but I saw many people were receiving great service from them .\\nGreat value and service for the price !\\nExcellent Service ,  Great Location\\n The staff and service were exceptional .\\nThe concierge can give discounts for booking city tours and for some restaurants, although we tried Neptune's which was recommended to us and felt it was overpriced for the service and quality .\\n I personally appreciated the free internet service in the hotel .\\nIn addition, they advertise Limousine service to the financial district but when I inquired they announce they had stopped the service and I would need to take mass transportation .\\nAs I checked out I expressed my disappointment there were no biscottis and transportation service and the check out clerk tells me they do have the service and I needed to make an appointment .\\n All employee's that I mentioned have shown customer service skills that are above and beyond .\\nWe had a discussion on the plane that it was such a shame that customer service was gone in so many companies these days .\\nThe rooms were a decent size for a city hotel and were very clean and well serviced .\\nWonderful service friendly people\\nseems service just isn't the way it used to be .\\ni'am 40 years old and its very disheartening that people have lost their pride of service and doing a good job .\\nWe have stayed at The Tuscan Inn on our last 3 trips to San Francisco, and I really can't fault the service .\\n The staff at this hotel make you feel so welcome and its service with a smile .\\n All the staff go the extra mile to assist in anyway they can and the staff of the ajoining Cafe Pescatore are just as welcoming, with great service and the food is excellent .\\n We ate at the Italian restaraunt located in the hotel and the food and service was outstanding .\\n Never experienced the room service .\\n Service was all good, albeit a bit stoic .\\n Unfortunately we didn't get to dine in the hotel restaurant, but I'd say it would be good, if the after hours service is anything to go by !\\n I'd highly recommend the Tuscan Inn based on location, cheerfulness of staff, aesthetics in the room and general overall service .\\nExcellent service great location good value\\nThe staff at the front desk could not have been more helpful and whilst we did not avail his services, the concierge always seemed to be busy with guests giving info and advice .\\n There was also a gentleman offering massage at this time and we met a few people who had enjoyed his services .\\n The food and service were both excellent .\\n This was probably not the best pick for us as we don't like tourist areas and Fishermans Wharf if one big tourist service .\\n There are many public transportation options including the cable cars, the trolley line and bus service .\\n The highlight of this hotel for us was the service offered by the staff, particularly the two concierges on duty while we were there .\\n Their service was of the level and knowledge I would expect at at 5, star hotel .\\n One day we had the do not disturb sign on the door before the maid had come so we could rest, and when we finally stepped out for about an hour, we changed the sign for maid service and everything was perfect when we returned !\\nAmenities ,  While this hotel isn't a luxury property, they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms, mini bar, room service and an evening wine reception every day   .\\n At this point I asked to be put through to Best Western Customer Services and amazingly our room was changed to a king bed suite as per our reservation within the hour .\\n They state that there is an obligatory service charge for tables of more than 6 .\\n We dined as a party of 4 and were still hit with this and then the waitress failed to hand over $10 of change taking this as an additional service charge .\\n We were very impressed with the service we received .\\nThe concierge service is second to none .\\nTuscan Inn has it all, exellant location,very close to public transport, very clean, impeccable, friendly service and a supermarket opposite .\\nWe found a great breakfast place just around the corner in Taylor St, called Darren's Cafe, good prices with excellant food and service .\\n Valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick .\\n very clean,well maintained,with efficient,if not overly friendly service .\\nThe hotel makes a big thing of the coffee bisc service in the morning,and this is quite nice .\\n I'd say that,as far as the evening   wine service is concerned,if you happen to be in the hotel,it's fine .\\n Did not eat at the restaurant, but room service was great .\\n Overall, the stay at The Tuscan Inn was great and would highly recommend due to the room service .\\n There are other hotels in the area who do not offer room service .\\nThe service in the hotel was really good .\\n The restaurant in the hotel ,  Cafe Pescatore ,  does the breakfast run for room service, it was adequate but a little overpriced .\\n Lunch and dinner room service is provided by North Beach Pizza, which deliveries many Italian specialties including pasta, entrees, salads, sandwiches and of course ,  pizza .\\n However, there are countless restaurants of all sorts and price ranges within a 1, 4 block walk of this hotel, there is little reason to order room service .\\n We did not use this service but thought it was nice that it was available if needed .\\n We did not eat at the hotel restaurant, we chose to eat at the IHOP around the corner for breakfast and it was good food and service, and they are open 24 hours .\\n Maid service was prompt and outstanding .\\nvery good hotel ,  great location, concierge extremely helpful, decor is nice and the maid service was excellent   .\\n The customer service was wonderful .\\n The adjacent Cafe Pescatero was handy for breakfast but had some hiccups in service, but it was okay overall .\\n, provide service like high end hotels .\\nWill store your luggage in separate room on your check out day if you have late flight, want to spend more time,Oldest Italian restaurant in the country w in walking distance, back east service, integrity, etc .\\n Split a fare w a private service i .\\n, we walked everywhere including up the hill to Coit Tower   then walked down just in time to attend 1300 service @ St .\\n The staff was so friendly and helpful and the concierge service was very knowledgeable .\\n A masseur was giving guests a massage at the same location, not sure if there was a charge involved for that service, as there was no information about that anywhere .\\nThe hotel is conveniently located to the shopping centre across the road, and we made use of this to purchase our breakfast requirements, as we had not had great service from the adjoining cafe Pescatore for our evening meal and thought we would do our own thing each morning .\\nHousekeeping service was very inadequate, though .\\nand the service was just ok too .\\n The whole trip was ruined by the guest service of the hotel .\\n They say they pride themselves on being the best in guest service but I was not impressed at all .\\nThe valet parking was overpriced, the service was terrible, and the coffe was cold .\\nservice was extra good, very friendly and there is a great cafe across the street   which has the best breakfast in the world .\\n The service was fine with the exception of check, in .\\n From reading other reviews, it seems as though this hotel has significant lapses in service from time to time .\\n Nevertheless, I did like this hotel,  the rooms, location, and most of the service and I would stay here again .\\nNice place but service could be better\\n Overall we had a nice stay but just had some minor service issues .\\n When we finally found the church later, the service times she had given us were wrong, too .\\n Speaking of parking, you're going to have to pay and it's going to have to be valet service, as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .\\n The hotel is pretty much as you'd expect from the chain , nice clean rooms well serviced, and the staff were extremely helpful,  very pleasant to deal with .\\n Service was poor and they got our order wrong, but they did correct it at no extra cost and the food was good .\\nGreat service and friendly Front Desk .\\n The Concierge service is excellent .\\n Valet parking was $36 a day, but we're not complaining because other SF wharf hotels have charged us a similar fee even without the valet service .\\n This hotel is truly a value for the mid, level traveler looking for excellent accomodations and the HIGHEST LEVEL OF SERVICE ANYWHERE !\\n But the maid service was excellent, it was very clean and the bed was comfortable .\\n The service from every staff member we encountered was delightful .\\nGreat location service and beer .\\nThe hotel room was average although the service was good .\\nIn accordance with the Tuscan Inn\\u0092s Italian style theme a coffee tea biscotti service was open from 6am till 9am in the mornings .\\n In the evenings from 5pm till 6pm a wine, beer and sparkling water service was available .\\n Maid service was prompt, too .\\n the service is poor, and for those used to staying in Kimpton hotels .\\nThere is simply not the service, oriented feeling one is used to in this hotel group .\\n It has everthing you need to have a great time in a great city,  location, good service, great food  , comfortable rooms and a complimentary happy hour .\\n The cafe is comfortable and service was attentive and polite .\\nRoom service at the hotel is limited :\\n The rooms are small but very clean, charmingly decorated with a view of the little flowered courtyard, comfy beds, plenty of pillows   towels and smiling service .\\n I really didn't get a chance to experience the staff's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom .\\n One other thing, I took my family to the eating establishment connected to this hotel and the service there was TERRIBLE !\\n The concierge, in turn, told us to see the bellman, who said the shuttle did not run on weekends and he knew nothing about how to arrange the service .\\n We ate there several times and never had a bad meal or poor service .\\n While we were making these arrangements, the valet secured a shuttle service to get us to the airport on time .\\n Found the food there to be quite nice, and our service was always prompt and efficient .\\nI planned a weekend getaway and thought because of the location and Hotel chain we would receive good service .\\n The service was excellent, the room was terrific, the bed was incredibly comfortable and the hotel is centrally located to all the major attractions of San Francisco .\\nVery clean room, great location, wonderful service and dog friendly .\\n The personalized service always stands out and if we have a problem, it is immediately remedied .\\n WORST BW we've ever stayed in as far as service goes .\\n We ate breakfast there one day and were appalled at the slow service, rude waitstaff, and overpriced breakfast food .\\n I had breakfast and dinner a few times at the restaurant joined to the hotel, Cafe Pescatore, and thought the food and the service were both very good .\\n The rooms were great and the Service wonderful .\\n The only complaint I have is the Valet service .\\n The front desk is the worst service I have had in years .\\n And the hotel restaurant food and service was   awful .\\ngreat rooms fantastic location and great service !\\n i would also urge other vistors to prebook Alacatraz with Blue and Gold Fleet direct on there website before they arrive in San Fran as you can pick up your tickets at the self service machine without the miles of queues !\\n The food at the &quot Cafe&quot  is quite &quot hotel, like&quot  but the service makes up for it .\\n friendly service was evident each day and the gentleman conceirge was patient and helpful .\\n The valet guy was extremely helpful and very friendly but the check in guest services staff on the whole uninterested and unhelpful .\\n The hotel restaurant was a bit over priced but good service and good quality .\\nCourteous, responsive service and a great location !\\n The service was good, the wine service each evening was very nice   next to the fireplace, and the location was awesome !\\n The service was friendly and helpful at the front desk, but the conciege that I dealt with was not very good .\\n Excellent staff and service and the adjoining Italian restaurant was superb .\\n A very cheerful staff and prompt service .\\n Great people, service was terrefic, especially during this stressful time !\\n Teaming this Hotel with the great food   service @ Cafe Pescatore, I would definitely choose this hotel again while in SF, an experience we won't ever forget .\\n I was also disappointed that the hotel's &quot room service&quot  came from a nearby pizzeria, but the hotel still charged a fee on each delivery .\\n Being that I worked as a front desk person at a Best Western for quite awhile I was on the lookout for good service and facilities .\\n We asked her how to get back to the airport without having to pay the shuttle service $15 each .\\n And value is key for the rooms and the service !\\n The service is always great and the rooms very clean .\\nnette Lage aber durchschnittlicher Service !\\n\",\n          \" The room was not overly big, but clean and very comfortable beds, a great shower and very clean bathrooms .\\n The second room was smaller, with a very inconvenient bathroom layout, but at least it was quieter and we were able to sleep .\\n Large comfortable room, wonderful bathroom .\\n The rooms were nice, very comfy bed and very clean bathroom .\\n Bathroom was spacious too and very clean .\\n The bathroom only had a single sink, but it was very large .\\n The room was a standard but nice motel room like any other, bathroom seemed upgraded if I remember .\\nThe room was quite small but perfectly formed with a super bathroom .\\n You could eat off the bathroom floor it was so clean .\\n The bathroom door does the same thing, making the bathroom seem slightly larger .\\nbathroom spotless and nicely appointed .\\n The rooms are exceptionally clean and also the bathrooms .\\n The bathroom was clean and the bed was comfy .\\n They provide you with great aveda products in the bathroom .\\n Also, the bathroom was a bit dirty ,  brown water came out of the bath tub faucet initially and the sink wall by the toilet was dirty .\\n If your dog tends to be a little disruptive or on the noisy side, there is a bathroom fan that you can keep on to make noise .\\n The bathroom was big and clean as well .\\n Also, the bathrooms were quite well set up, with a seperate toilet shower to basin, so whilst one guest is showering another can use the basin .\\n The bathroom was marble and we had luxurious bathrobes and really, every detail attended to .\\n It was very clean, had a beautiful bathroom, and was comfortable .\\n The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was clean with a nice selection of toiletries .\\n The bathroom was an adequate size .\\nFirst, from day one our bathroom had a urine smell that never went away .\\n Otherwise the bathroom was decent enough ,  decent temperature and decent water pressure .\\n Bathroom shower curtain reeked of mildew enough to smell up the room .\\n The bed was comfortable and the rooms and bathrooms were kept clean and although the refrigerators are honour bars the hotel is happy for you to chill your own drinks in them .\\n The room was very nice, and had a nice bathroom .\\n The room was wonderful with great beds, a nice bathroom and we also had an excellent view of Coit Tower as well .\\n The room was small, with a king bed, and a truly claustrophobic bathroom .\\nAmenities ,  While this hotel isn't a luxury property, they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms, mini bar, room service and an evening wine reception every day   .\\n The bathroom was clean, well lit, and always well stocked with shampoo etc and towels .\\n The only odd thing was the bathroom door and room door opened outwards into the room and hallway respectively .\\n Room spacious 2 double beds gave us plenty of room, the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was a good size .\\n The bathroom was large and included a mounted makeup mirror .\\n The rooms are abit smallish  , but immaculately maintained, and tastefully decorated, with excellent bathroom facilities .\\n Shower bathroom was good with good shower and plenty of space .\\n Both the bedroom and bathroom had plenty of room .\\n large clean bathrooms fully stocked with everything needed .\\n However, when we arrived at our room there was a maintenance worker there measuring the bathroom counter, so maybe they're doing work in some units .\\n The room was large and very comfortable with a nice large bathroom .\\n There is a wall, mounted hair dryer in the bathroom .\\nThe thing that bothered me the most was the bathroom was very dated .\\n There is virtually no counterspace in the bathroom at all .\\n Upon our arrival, there was a SLIGHT odor in bathroom but nothing worth complaining about .\\n The bathroom was adequate with thick, fluffy towels .\\n The bathroom was large and private .\\n The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\nThe Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\nmy only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n The room was a good size but the bathroomm was very small .\\n Bathroom was adequate and clean and there was a hairdryer .\\n The wash basin was in the room without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath shower .\\n The bathroom had not been remodeled in alignment, but it was all very clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n The bathroom had several problems .\\n Bathrooms were also very nice .\\n The shower stall could have been bigger as the bathroom itself was pretty large .\\n Then they gave us a room which had a view of a wall, a tiny bathroom so small in fact that the sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n The room is not the most modern room but there was tons of space especially in the bathroom .\\n We may have had an ADA room because it was pretty big with large bathroom ,  it was room 459 ,  and the room had all the amenities we were looking for .\\nThe room   and bathroom were perfect in size,  just what is needed .\\n The only possible complaint was that the sink in the bathroom had a crack in it, but it did not bother me enough to ask for a different room .\\n Bathrooms, though, are plenty big .\\n Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly .\\n It represents value for money, the rooms and bathrooms were impeccably clean, fresh linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly .\\n There were plenty of thick towels in the bathroom, and all the usual toiletries, hair, dryer, etc .\\n I really didn't get a chance to experience the staff's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom .\\n The bathroom was also small  it was difficult to close the door once inside to avoid the door hitting you no joke !\\n Some rooms had the bathroom sink outside the bathroom, which we would have preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries   were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle .\\n The rooms were very nice, could of use just a little more shelf space by the bathroom sink .\\n The bathroom was clean but a little dated .\\n The only thing wrong with the room was the bathroom, it was not up to the standard of the rest of the decor but it was clean and large enough .\\n The bathroom was just okay, but for the price we survived .\\n Hair dryer in bathroom constantly fell in sink from it's holder when anyone used the door to our room .\\n The reasonable price of the hotel allowed us to book 2 rooms, thus giving the 4 of us a bit more space and 2 bathrooms   .\\n Plenty of room in the bathroom .\\n Nice clean rooms and a spaciousbathroom .\\n The only minor downside, as a few others have mentioned, is the bathroom sink lighting .\\n Did not like the bathroom light shining into bedroom   .\\n Only negative is the bathroom area is a little small .\\n Our suite we had was small there was pubic hair on the bathroom floor from  ?\\nbathroom a little on the older side .\\n The bathroom needed a face, lift also .\\n The bathrooms are quite small compared to other hotels but adequate .\\n The hotel was of a good standard, big clean rooms, decent bathroom and the free wine reception in the evening was an added bonus .\\n\"\n        ],\n

including a brighter screen and better video battery life, but probably the most appealing aspect is the tantalizing price points of $249 for the 30GB version and $349 for the huge 80GB version

lasts me a good length of time doing that .\\n doesn't take pictures, battery life  It's my first ipod, but it's amazing .\\n Also, the battery life wasn't that long enough for me, but i'm new to this

Compact, Easy To Set Up, Reliable Performance, Great Sound, Lots of Storage bought it for the gym and it was just the right weight !\\nMy only complaint with this product is that the battery doesn't last long at all\\nI bought the nano as a replacement for an older classic, which was a great unit but time has taken it's toll on the battery and screen .\\n\",\n          \" Keep in mind that once you get in a room full of light or step outdoors screen reflections could become annoying .\\n I've used mine outside on a sunny day, and the screen is still very much legible .\\n In fact it was much more detailed than the matte screen on my Dell D600 .\\n Some ppl may prefer a higher resolution screen but I don't think it's required .\\n I delayed ordering the computer because of the horror stories of bad batteries, faulty chargers and blue screen crashes .\\n1 inch screens, Windows XP operating systems, a plethora of USB ports, a card reader, WiFi and most have a few color choices .\\n1 inch screens are a bit cramped if several toolbars have been turned on .\\n Some of the Asus special on screen controls, update and expand features built into the machine have not been all that useful and some border on being advertisements for buying Asus stuff .\\n Two other things that make this a superior computer are battery life, and the LED backlighting for the screen .\\n The ways the screen opens   enables a smaller footprint when the case is closed, although it limits how far back the screen will tilt .\\n Surfing the net is a breeze, but I did have one  blue screen of death  when dealing with one demanding internet site .\\n The light weight, the battery life, the keyboard, the non, protruding removable battery, the bright screen, the track pad disable button and general ease of use makes it hard to beat .\\n I recommend minimizing the size of the scroll zones on the right and bottom, other wise you find the screen suddenly scrolling when you did not want it to do so .\\n zoom in or zoom out of a screen  , but on occasion it will zoom when you don't want or expect it to because of an inadvertent gesture or touch by a thumb, etc .\\n The occasional blue screen of death unfortunately has not gone away  Microsoft attributes it to an errant driver, but I have not been able to isolate what driver is the cause .\\nThe screen is not as bright as my Acer .\\n There are 2 bios updates and the latest is for a brighter screen setting .\\n This makes the screen much brighter and as with all new computers it seems there are always important updates .\\nAlso if you install Firefox web browser and push the f11 key the browser becomes full screen, helpful on a small screen .\\n I got used to the glossy screens a while ago  this one is remarkably bright and vivid .\\n Now I keep getting the  blue screen  serious errors .\\n wrote  it has crashed unexpectedly and displayed the blue screen of death numerous times .\\n Sometimes the blue screen of death appears for no discernible reason .\\nI began by considering netbooks with screens smaller than the now, standard 10 .\\n If money is your leading consideration, then one of these may be for you, but for just a bit more money you get a much better screen, better battery life, bigger drive, more upgradeable, etc .\\n But with screen brightness cranked up, bluetooth & wi, fi in constant use, some video playback  , and internet radio running, I'm getting a good 8\\n With wi, fi off & the screen dimmed, I don't think I'll have a problem getting the stated 10 .\\n The keyboard is not quite perfect, the screen doesn't tilt back as far as I'd like, slightly higher resolution in the screen would be nice a new model not yet available in the U .\\n has an 11  screen with the same or better battery life, .\\n It's small with a very clear screen .\\n I've had the 1005HA, PU1X for a week now ,  on and running applications continuously ,  without a single crash, blue screen, or hangup .\\n The touchpad feels great, the boot up was fast, keyboard feels comfortable, and the screen is good .\\n My only complaint with it is that the screen doesn't go back far enough .\\n The touchpad works well, the screen glossy, ness really doesn't bother me, and it's not too bad of a fingerprint magnet .\\n On full screen display is smooth and no issues .\\n Some iTunes content is a little laggy if it is maximized display, but not full screen for some reason, but switching to full screen display has taken care of that issue for me .\\n And with a two, fingered gesture on the scratchpad, you can enlarge or shrink the screen .\\n It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n On a full charge, with wireless on, screen brightness on medium, I get a reported 8 .\\n5 hours with no wireless, and screen brightness on minimum .\\n5 PASS ,  Screen is bright and large enough .\\n Once I configured Firefox to always run full screen mode  , surfing was no problem with plenty of screen real estate .\\n All features worked excellently for me so far especially appreciate the touchpad lock button  as well as the screen off function key .\\nheavy rearward weight bias so much that it wants to fall backwards  with the screen pushed back all the way\\n the screen is STUNNING, and if you've got a bright light shining down on it, you've got a choice :\\n you can either move the screen to eliminate the glare, or move the lamp .\\n I'd far rather have this beautifully crisp screen and make the occasional adjustment for glare, than deal with a matte screen 24 7 .\\nOne of the other complaints I'd come across is how for some, the screen doesn't tilt back far enough .\\nyeah, you'd probably want the screen to tilt far enough back to lay flat .\\n And if you can't wait to twist yourself into some contortion in bed where you need the screen to go back further than reasonable, you can always invest in one of those $20 lap desks ,  you know, the kind with the beanbag bottom, so that you can shift the desk into whatever ridiculous position will suit your fancy .\\nand I could have gotten a matte screen, but neither of those  features  impressed me .\\n Except for difficulties seeing the entire New York Times crossword puzzle all at once on the screen, the Asus satisfies my needs and seems about as fast as my 5, year, old IBM laptop .\\n I was also nervous about the fact that occasionally the image on the computer screen  shivered , although it normally recovered from that .\\n Also considered lower, end 14, 15  screens for use of the DVD .\\n I like the gloss screen fine .\\n The screen is too small for any meaningful work, but the apps DO work .\\n Again, the screen is too small for this to be anything more than just satisfying from a purchase standpoint .\\n like others have said, it is definitely a fingerprint magnet, and the glossy screen can be a bit of a problem in some lighting conditions .\\nI received my Asus 1005HA yesterday installed the two gb ram and tried to turn it on and the screen remained blank .\\nThe screen is small, only 1024 x 600 .\\nI can hear the windows but my screen is totally blank .\\n I can tell the backlight is on, but all I get is a black screen .\\n I don't even see the bios screen on startup .\\n The screen is sharp and bright .\\n The screen is clear and easily viewed in indoor environments .\\n With the view maximized, the screen is large enough to work on documents and read online research materials .\\n The fashionable glossiness of both body and screen acquires fingerprints and smears rapidly .\\n The shiny screen is reflective, which can be a problem if you have your back to a sunny window or work outdoors .\\n I keep the screen brightness set at about half and easily get more than eight hours with wi, fi on .\\n I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about as far as the screen brightness goes because my screen is far too bright at the higher end of the spectrum .\\n It is a fingerprint magnet, and because of the glossy screen, its very reflective of light .\\n,  don't know why they use the screen size most do ,  1024 x 600 seems cramped\\n Takes sometime to get use to the small screen .\\n yeah, the new LED screen technology is that good .\\nThe screen resolution isn't the highest you can get but I found that the higher resolution netbooks usually had older prcessors for some reason .\\n I'm happy with the screen and resolution choices available .\\n I usually run IE8 in full screen mode   with a 95% zoom setting and a 1024x600 resolution .\\nSurprisingly readable screen for the size .\\n 4 DO NOT GET WAX ON YOUR SCREEN .\\n Hit F11 and you have full screen browsing ,  just move the cursor to the top of the screen for the controls .\\nThe screen really is too small ,  1024x600 is barely livable .\\nWith the battery in the back the computer has most of its weight in the back so the computer easily tips back when the screen is opened all the way up .\\nScreen brightness is very satisfactory .\\n ASUS Docking is a program to have a quick menu on top of your screen to access all ASUS software .\\nThe screen is easy to read in outside lighting conditions .\\n My other HP laptop has a mat screen surface and is almost impossible to read outside .\\n Long battery life, sharp looking machine, fingerprint magnet,glossy screen=glare,ease of use and portability .\\n The most noticeable difference is the screen and keyboard functionality .\\n The cover and screen are glossy and it has a 92% keyboard which is plenty comfortable .\\n The battery life is excellent, with normal usage I can get about 7 hours easily, more if I turn off WIFI and turn down the screen brightness .\\nOne of the downside I have noticed is that the netbook is heavy near the hinge because that's where the battery is located and if you want to put it on your lap while sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .\\n Screen is nice, and adequately sized, , use fullscreen browsing .\\n I also needed Web connectivity for research, a screen with a low squint factor and a keyboard that wasn't too cramped .\\nThe screen size works just fine for me .\\n Having the touchpad feature of expanding zooming the presentation on the screen is a nice feature, but I have to admit having never needing to use it   .\\n And it goes in that bag wrapped in the white paper plastic bag it was originally boxed up in, with another piece of packing plastic between the keyboard and the screen .\\n, I'm still getting used to the small screen .\\nTiny screen compromises the experience of web surfing\\n I'll see the first black screen, it appears to be starting, and then stays with either a grey or black screen .\\n3 sometimes the screen will all of a sudden distort and I have to re, start to get it to work .\\n 1 keyboard still floats  2the screen goes to a solid blue screen either right after starting or after it sits a while .\\n Great battery life, decent sized screen, and the keyboard was large enough to be comfortable to type on .\\n Very nice, in fact, though I strongly dislike glossy screens ,  no matter, I knew it would have one when I ordered it .\\nThe battery life has been very good, especially if you follow the rule of turning off the wireless and bluetooth, and turning down the screen brightness .\\n9  screens, but felt that was too much of a sacrifice .\\n The screen is small but still large enough to read comfortably   .\\n0 out of 5 stars Bad LCD Screen, October 7, 2009\\n I fired it up and out of the box it has a vertical red line on the LCD screen .\\njust a big dark, screen paperweight .\\n The netbook is light and sturdy, and it the screen looks great .\\n only 10, inch screen, small keyboard and no CD, ROM .\\nMy advice is to visit a store to personally try the keyboard and screen size .\\n Decent speed processor, nice screen quality, great asus softwares  , and very long battery life .\\n pretty decent screen quality .\\n although the screen is relatively small to my eyes   it wasn't really hard to get used to the size and the screen is clear and bright, no prob reading articles and writing essays .\\nOne of the things that I found difficult to get used to is the size of the screen .\\n 10  can be enough for some, but it was kinda small for me, so the thing I did was try to max out the screens by removing unnecessary menus .\\nWhen using Internet explorer or Firefox, press F11 and the screen will enlarge, giving you some additional freedom and space .\\n GLOSSY SCREENS ARE THE STUPIDEST INVENTION OF THIS MILLENIUM .\\n Seeing reflections on the screen is just plain annoying .\\n As new netbooks come out, look for the ones with matt screen and see if it has a good feature set and price .\\n The screen is very sharp and readable even with the tiny text at this size .\\n With 1GB of RAM, it really isn't TOO bad to try to run Photoshop or something either  , but the screen would be too small for something like that anyhow .\\nThe battery life is unbelievable, even while using USB to transfer files, watching movies and surfing the internet with screen brightness all the way up .\\nFactory settings to preserve battery life have the screen luminescence set to 50% but can easily be adjusted to the necessary ambience illumination you may need .\\n The 1024x600 screen can be set, if you wish, so that it is a 1024x600 viewport to a larger 1024x768 desktop, reachable by moving the mouse to the screen edge .\\n This is useful if you have an application that demands a 1024x768 screen .\\n Screen appearance is enhanced by Asus software, and I do like the appearance and visibility in various lighting situations .\\n The 10 inch screen started getting to me on the Asus 1005 .\\nI love the capability of making the screen bigger or smaller with the mouse pad .\\n The mouse pad is very sensitive so I sometimes find myself on a different part of the screen if I accidentally touch something .\\n The screen is comfortable and sufficently bright for occassional use .\\n The screen is crisp and clear, and the unit runs great .\\n The greatest shortcoming is the small screen resolution .\\n Yes, screen is small, video card is weak, and keyboard is cramped, but this is the case for other netbooks at this price point .\\n I have not done an actual test of the full battery life but from what iv seen in general use it has around 9 hours while running wifi and other applications with around half screen brightness .\\n Streaming videos from Hulu and Netflix look incredible on this 10 inch screen .\\nThe only minor issue that I have with 1005HA is that it does not allow the screen to rotate further .\\n The screen rotation angle is good enough for putting the netbook on desktop .\\n Due to the size of netbooks and a wide screen format, the screen should have been designed to be able to rotate all the way back to inline with the keyboard .\\n The screen is very bright and sharp with a maximum resolution of 1024x600 .\\n The 10, inch screen is bright and has good color, and the keyboard is only slightly smaller than a regular one .\\n Performance is good, screen very good, wireless very good, numerous USB ports, and keyboard layout is excellent .\\n It boots up quickly, especially after getting rid of the extra asus software that auto, boots at startup, its battery life is phenomenal, the screen is clear and easy to read, the keyboard is comfortable to type on and feels natural .\\n But even with that, and the glossy screen, fingerprint magnet, limited screen tilt, tinny speakers, and intermittent odd glitches, I still think it's a great value and would buy it again today if I were on the market for a netbook .\\n Now the screen is cracked with big black blotches as well .\\nBlue screen crashed several times .\\nHard to see full web pages on small screen, resolution inadequate .\\n Instead I convert DVDs to DVIX AVI files using Fair Use Wizard and load them on to memory slot card and they play great, 700mb files look fine on this size of screen .\\n The screen resolution can be a little small at times, but that is a sacrifice I was willing to make .\\n Yes it does take some getting use to a smaller screen, the key board actually works better than my laptop though  .\\nI was worried the screen size would be too small and uncomfortable to read, but it has been great for everything I run :\\n Most of my professors teach from Power Points, and it makes my life so much simpler having the PPT on my screen that I can annotate while listening to the lecture .\\n I have not accidentally knocked it over, but I think it could easily be done  the screen is glossy   .\\n Purchased this machine to enjoy the convenience of Windows and the larger screen .\\n years old, so the screen size was also a concern, but it is adequate for the type of things I use it for .\\n As soon as you connect the VGA cable to an unknown projector and press the function key for projection, it automatically adjusts the size and resolution to fit the projector even if it cannot display properly on its own screen .\\n The keyboard is great and the screen looks good .\\n It's also a shame that this model comes with a glossy screen .\\n I personally haven't had a problem with the screen, but it would be fairly unusable outdoors in the sun .\\nFor this extra amount, I was looking for the larger screen, the longer battery life and the keyboard ergonomics .\\n I have more productivity  flow  on a conventional laptop with a full sized screen and keyboard .\\nThis machine is plenty fast, it's just that if I try to do work with it ,  my office's order entry system as displayed on the netbook screen must be scrolled up and down since it's a  chopped  1024 x 600 height screen, instead of the more usual 786 .\\nyou lose those 186 pixels and even one line of a large order maintenance screen can require you to have to break the flow of productivity to scroll .\\nThe small screen is probably the biggest drawback .\\n Could be better and don't use the highest resolution unless you want all of your stuff to have the wrong aspect ration on the screen It flattens it to make more visible .\\n Browsing is amazingly better by using full screen mode on browser with F11 .\\n That extra space the menu and address bar take up are sorely needed on this small screen .\\n In full screen browsing it is so much better that I would never go back .\\n Because the screen is so small in order to get the standard 1024x 768 display without having to scroll the normal screen the screen has to be  smashed  so the display is slightly altered .\\nOne hint ,  there's a setting that lets you  compress  the screen which makes everything smaller and allows you to fit more on the screen .\\n I mostly find that when I make typos, it's not because of the keyboard, it's because of the smallness of the screen, , I just can't see what I'm doing as well as a laptop .\\nAs others have noted, I wish the screen wasn't so reflective .\\n And maybe it's something I need to figure out how to fix, but I don't like the aspect ratio of the screen either .\\n Has all the features of my bigger laptop except a large screen .\\n1 inch screen is bigger than the 8 .\\n I want a netbook for portability, not screen real estate .\\n, I was willing to downsize my screen size in favor of portability and speed .\\n\",\n          \",  I think the new keyboard rivals the great hp mini keyboards .\\nSince the battery life difference is minimum, the only reason to upgrade would be to get the better keyboard .\\n The keyboard is now as good as the HP and Samsung netbooks .\\n The keyboards are 92% the size of those found on a standard computer and the machines run a little hot .\\n The keyboard is large enough to accommodate touch typing with ease .\\n At home I now have my Asus connected to my desktop's keyboard and monitor .\\n However, since I do a lot of word processing, the keyboard and the touchpad buttons were a real concern .\\n The keyboard has a responsive feel and the larger keys   along with the oversize right shift key are a real plus .\\n The light weight, the battery life, the keyboard, the non, protruding removable battery, the bright screen, the track pad disable button and general ease of use makes it hard to beat .\\n Battery life continues to hold up and the keyboard is a true godsend with its full size keys .\\n, Tiny and light the slightly smaller than standard keyboard is no problem for me to use, , and I'm a touch typist, , the keys themselves are a good size and feel good .\\n The keyboard is quite nice and I have very large hands and I make a lot fewer mistakes .\\nThe fit and finish are very good, no gaps and I like the keyboard layout .\\n The keyboard is easy to use .\\n The keyboard has a decent feel but seems more cramped than the 1005ha .\\n Definitely the best looking netbook, and possibly the best keyboard .\\n The keyboard is not quite perfect, the screen doesn't tilt back as far

hands and with a little time on the keyboard I'm breezing through word processing jobs .\\nI found the ASUS keyboard comfortable to type quickly  it is touch, typeable after brief acclimation .\\n The

doesn't have separation between the keys   .\\nI also noticed within the second or third day of use that the keyboard was loose .\\n I found if I pushed down and slid upward in the upper left corner,

getting rid of the extra asus software that auto, boots at startup, its battery life is phenomenal, the screen is clear and easy to read, the keyboard is comfortable to type on and feels natural .\\n Like how they made keyboard as large as possible unlike Qosmio 17  which is almost same size .\\n  The selling point, for me, was the keyboard .\\n I wanted to purchase a netbook with a keyboard as close to a lap or desktop as possible .\\n Keyboard is actually nice to work on  connected to my wireless network immediately  light, weight of course .\\n Luckily, there's a keyboard shortcut to toggle it on off .\\n It's 90% size keyboard doesn't take too long to get used to .\\n First and foremost, most companies  , get the design of the keyboard completely wrong .\\n I was also extremely impressed at how comfortable the keyboard is .\\n I love the feel of typing on it, and have not had any issues transferring from a regular, sized keyboard to a smaller one .\\n My biggest concern was how I would handle a smaller keyboard .\\n For regular typing, the keyboard has worked well .\\n I have had a freeze up twice where the mouse and keyboard stop responding .\\n The keyboard feel is good but the touchpad is hard and being small I get confused with the side scroll area easily .\\n The keyboard is great and the screen looks good .\\nFor this extra amount, I was looking for the larger screen, the longer battery life and the keyboard ergonomics .\\nProductivity wasn't a huge benefit, but I did feel the keyboard was a major selling point for the extra dough .\\n I have more productivity  flow  on a conventional laptop with a full sized screen and keyboard .\\n I was afraid I wouldn't like the small keyboard, but it's really easy to type on .\\n Excellent keyboard for typing .\\n I also have the Eeepc 900, but I can't stand typing on that keyboard ,  I've typed on this one for 10 hour work training sessions without issue .\\n The keyboard and buttons felt good for a small netbook .\\nThe keyboard is smallish, but not ridiculously small .\\n The keyboard is surprisingly good for someone like me with big hands .\\n No keyboard issues on any of them, no running hot, although the adapters do get really warm .\\nWindows started crashing, freezing, unable to boot, keyboard or touchpad not working, etc .\\n The keyboard is very easy to adjust to and is very comfortable to use .\\n The keyboard is nearly full size and very comfortable to type on for hours .\\nThe keyboard is awesome since it looks like regular one with a large backspace, and two shifts .\\nI like the zoom in out feature on the keyboard !\\n The keyboard is only slightly smaller than a regular one, so it's very comfortable .\\n I mostly find that when I make typos, it's not because of the keyboard, it's because of the smallness of the screen, , I just can't see what I'm doing as well as a laptop .\\nA lot of netbooks on the market have mangled the keyboard in one way or another such that if you are a touch typist, you find yourself hitting the wrong key often, which is frustrating .\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n
